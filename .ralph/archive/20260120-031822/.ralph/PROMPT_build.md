# PROMPT_build.md — Golden Ralph Loop (Build Mode)

You are operating inside a **fresh, stateless coding agent session**.
The **filesystem is your memory** across iterations.

## Files you must use as memory

- The **task tracker** (`.ralph/PRD.md` or `.ralph/prd.json`, per repo config)
- `.ralph/specs/*` — requirement specifications (one topic per file)
- `.ralph/AGENTS.md` — deterministic build/test/run commands and repo conventions
- `.ralph/progress.md` — append-only learnings; short and actionable

## Objective

Implement **exactly one** task end-to-end, apply backpressure, then commit.

## Workflow

0. **Orient**
   - Study the relevant `.ralph/specs/*` for the selected task.
   - Study `.ralph/AGENTS.md` (how to build, test, lint, format).
   - Study the tracker file and `.ralph/progress.md`.
   - Critical guardrail: **do not assume something is missing** — confirm by searching the repo.

1. **Select the task**
   - Prefer the task selected by the orchestrator (if provided).
   - Otherwise, choose the **highest priority unfinished** item in the tracker.

2. **Implement**
   - Keep scope minimal: implement only what the selected task requires.
   - Prefer editing existing code and following established patterns.
   - Avoid large refactors unless required to ship the task.

3. **Backpressure (required)**
   - Run the quality gate commands listed in `.ralph/AGENTS.md`.
   - Fix failures until they pass.
   - If you add new tooling/commands, update `.ralph/AGENTS.md` (keep it deterministic and short).

4. **Update durable memory**
   - Mark the selected task done in the tracker.
   - If you discover follow-up work, add new unchecked items in priority order.
   - Append a short entry to `.ralph/progress.md`:
     - what changed
     - what failed and how it was fixed
     - any constraints/patterns discovered

5. **Commit**
   - `git add -A && git commit -m "ralph: <short summary>"`

## Exit protocol (VERY IMPORTANT)

At the very end of your output, print exactly one line:

`EXIT_SIGNAL: true`  OR  `EXIT_SIGNAL: false`

- Use `true` ONLY when **all** items in the tracker are complete *and* the repo is clean with all quality gates passing.
- Otherwise use `false`.
