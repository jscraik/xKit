# AUDIENCE_JTBD.md

This file captures *who* the system is for and *what job* they are hiring it to do.
It exists to keep specs and plans grounded and to prevent unhelpful feature drift.

## Primary audience

- Who are they?
- What context are they in?
- What constraints do they have (time, compliance, devices, risk tolerance)?

## Jobs To Be Done (JTBD)

Write 3–7 JTBD statements in the format:

> When <situation>, I want to <motivation/goal>, so I can <expected outcome>.

Examples:
- When I deploy a new release, I want to validate core flows quickly, so I can ship with confidence.

## Success criteria

- What does “done” look like?
- What metrics or outcomes matter?

## Non-goals

- What is explicitly out of scope?

## Risks / assumptions

- Known uncertainties to validate early.
