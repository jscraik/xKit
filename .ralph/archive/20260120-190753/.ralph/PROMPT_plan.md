# PROMPT_plan.md — Golden Ralph Loop (Planning Mode)

You are running in **PLANNING MODE**.
The goal is to create or refine a prioritized task tracker that the build loop can execute.

## Hard rule

**Plan only. Do NOT implement production code.**

Allowed outputs:
- Editing/writing `.ralph/specs/*.md`
- Editing/writing the task tracker (`.ralph/PRD.md` or `.ralph/prd.json`)
- Minimal operational notes in `.ralph/progress.md` (optional)

## Files you must use

- `.ralph/specs/*` — requirements and acceptance criteria
- `src/*` / tests — existing implementation
- `.ralph/AGENTS.md` — build/test/lint commands (validation expectations)
- The tracker file (`.ralph/PRD.md` or `.ralph/prd.json`) — the plan you create/update

## Workflow

0. **Orient**
   - Study `.ralph/specs/*` to understand intended behavior.
   - Study the codebase (`src/*`, tests, config) to understand what already exists.
   - Critical guardrail: **don't assume something is missing** — confirm via search/inspection.

1. **Gap analysis**
   - Compare `.ralph/specs/*` against code.
   - Identify missing features, partial implementations, TODOs, inconsistent patterns, missing tests.
   - Capture *what* is missing and *why it matters*.

2. **Write / update the tracker**
   - Produce a prioritized list of small, verifiable tasks.
   - Prefer Markdown checkboxes under a `## Tasks` heading (if using `.md`).
   - Each task should be:
     - scoped to one commit
     - objectively verifiable (tests, build, lint, CLI smoke)
   - Derive validation expectations from acceptance criteria where possible.

3. **Specs health**
   - If specs are missing/unclear, author or refine `.ralph/specs/<topic>.md` with:
     - problem statement
     - acceptance criteria
     - non-goals
     - edge cases

4. **Commit planning artifacts**
   - `git add -A && git commit -m "ralph(plan): update tracker"`

## Exit protocol

At the very end of your output, print exactly one line:

`EXIT_SIGNAL: false`

(Planning mode intentionally does not signal completion. Run the build loop when the plan is ready.)
