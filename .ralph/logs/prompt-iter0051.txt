You are operating inside the Ralph Gold loop.

Rules:
- Do exactly ONE task per iteration.
- Use the Memory Files below as the source of truth (especially ANCHOR and any Repo Prompt context pack).
- Make the smallest correct change-set that satisfies the task acceptance criteria.
- When you finish the task, mark it done in the PRD tracker.
- Do not mark tasks done if you did not run/confirm the configured gates pass locally.
- If you are blocked, record a clear reason (including commands + errors) in .ralph/progress.md and leave the task open.

## File writing authority (CRITICAL)
- **You are authorized to write code directly.** Create and modify files without asking for permission.
- **Do not stop and request approval.** You are autonomous—complete the full implementation.
- **Implement the entire solution** in one iteration. Don't design and then wait—design AND implement.
- Your task acceptance criteria are your complete authority to proceed with file changes.

Workflow:
1) Read Memory Files in order.
2) Re-state the task acceptance criteria.
3) Implement completely (write all necessary files).
4) Run the repo's gates (see .ralph/AGENTS.md) and fix failures.
5) Update PRD + progress.

Output:
- Prefer concise, factual updates.
- If you ran commands, include the command and 1-3 lines of the most relevant output.

Constraints:
- Work on exactly ONE task per iteration
- Do not claim completion without passing gates
- Prefer minimal diffs; keep repo clean
</ANCHOR>

## Orchestrator Addendum (auto-generated)
Iteration: 51

Hard iteration constraints:
- One task per iteration (one commit per iteration).
- Apply backpressure: run the commands in AGENTS.md and fix until they pass.

Selected task for this iteration:
- id: 18
- title: Add backup creation to `scripts/migrate-to-author-first.mjs`
- acceptance:
  - Copy entire `knowledge/` to `knowledge_backup_<timestamp>/`
  - Run `verifyBackup()` after copy
  - Throw if verification fails
  - Test: `node scripts/migrate-to-author-first.mjs --dry-run` creates backup

Do not work on any other task in this iteration.

<PROJECT_MEMORY>
## .ralph/AGENTS.md
# Ralph Gold Agents & Gates

This file is read by Ralph Gold each iteration.

## Gates (backpressure)

Ralph Gold will run gates *after* the agent makes changes. Configure them in `.ralph/ralph.toml`.

Recommended patterns:

### Option A (recommended): `prek` as the universal gate runner

- Put your quality contract in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
- Then enable the gate:
  - `[gates.prek] enabled = true` (runs `prek run --all-files`)

No git hooks are installed by Ralph Gold.

### Option B: Explicit commands

Examples:
- `uv run ruff check .`
- `uv run mypy src`
- `uv run pytest -q`
- `npm test`

## Review gate (cross-model)

Optionally enable `[gates.review]` to require a reviewer model to return `SHIP`.

## Notes

- Receipts are written under `.ralph/receipts/` each iteration.
- Repo Prompt context packs (if enabled) are written under `.ralph/context/`.

# Knowledge Reorganization PRD

## Overview

Reorganize the xKit knowledge base from category-first (`year/month/category/@handle/file.md`) to author-first structure (`year/month/@handle (real name)/category/file.md`) with enhanced filenames including date, handle, category, title, and short ID. Includes comprehensive migration tooling with atomic operations, automated rollback, degraded mode support, and full observability.

**Tech Spec:** `.spec/tech-spec-2026-01-20-knowledge-reorganization.md`

## Task Breakdown Guidelines

**CRITICAL:** Tasks must be atomic (5-15 minutes each) with specific acceptance criteria and test commands.

## Tasks

### Phase 1: Core Types

- [-] Create `src/bookmark-organization/types.ts` file
  - Add `AuthorFolder`, `KnowledgePath`, `FilenameComponents` interfaces

  - Prompt for confirmation: "Continue? [y/N]"
  - Exit if not 'y'
  - Test: `node scripts/migrate-to-author-first.mjs --dry-run` shows plan

### Phase 6: File Operations with Timeout

- [-] Add `moveFileWithTimeout()` to `scripts/migration/lib/files.ts`
  - Use `Promise.race()` with 5 second timeout
  - Copy file first, verify size matches, then delete source
  - Throw timeout error if stuck
  - Test: Manual verify with test files

### Phase 7: Checkpoint & Recovery

- [-] Add checkpoint system to `scripts/migration/lib/checkpoint.ts`

  - For each file: calculate new path, create author folder, create category folder
  - Call `moveFileWithTimeout()` for each file
  - Write checkpoint every 100 files
  - Show progress: `[=====>] 45% (382/847) | 234 files/sec`
  - Log each move to `migration.log`
  - Track errors (recoverable) and continue
  - Test: `node scripts/migrate-to-author-first.mjs --dry-run` on sample data

### Phase 9: Checksum Verification

  - `createMigrationLock()`: write `.migration-lock` with migration ID and timestamp
  - `checkMigrationLock()`: return true if lock exists
  - `clearMigrationLock()`: remove lock file
  - Test: `pnpm test -- src/bookmark-markdown/lock.test.ts` passes

- [ ] Update bookmark archiving to check for migration lock
  - In archiving entry point, call `checkMigrationLock()`
  - If locked, print warning and exit (pause archiving)
  - Test: Manual verify lock pauses archiving

### Phase 12: Degraded Mode

- [ ] Add degraded mode functions to `scripts/migration/lib/degraded.ts`
  - `markMigrationFailed()`: write `.migration-failed` marker with error
  - `isDegradedMode()`: check if marker exists
  - `getOutputDirectory()`: return `knowledge_degraded/` if failed
  - `clearDegradedMode()`: remove marker
  - Test: Manual verify degraded mode activation

- [ ] Update `MarkdownWriter` constructor to use degraded output
  - Call `isDegradedMode()` on init
  - If degraded, set `outputDir` to `knowledge_degraded/`
