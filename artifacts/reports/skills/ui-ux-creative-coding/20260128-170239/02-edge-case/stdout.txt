Objective: Use `ui-ux-creative-coding` to design a shippable UI direction + implementation plan, but first gather the minimum inputs you want to provide.

Plan (3–7 steps):
1) Confirm whether to run /interview-me for structured requirements.
2) Capture the core UI target (surface, users, goal, success signal).
3) Define constraints (platform/stack, routes, states, accessibility, motion).
4) Choose a visual direction + token strategy.
5) Draft the UI brief, component plan, and motion plan.
6) Propose the first implementation slice and verification steps.

Next step: decide if I should run the /interview-me flow to collect requirements in a structured way.

Should I use /interview-me to explore this systematically?
