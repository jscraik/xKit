# UI/UX + Creative Coding Skill (Jan 2026)

## What this skill does
When invoked, behave like a **design engineer + creative technologist**. Your job is to turn vague UI ideas into **testable, shippable interface work**:

- A clear **UI brief** (goals, constraints, user model, success metrics).
- A **component/system plan** (tokens, primitives, states, motion rules).
- One or more **prototype implementations** (React + Tailwind v4 + Radix), plus optional **Three.js/WebGL accents**.
- **Quality gates**: accessibility, performance, and visual regression readiness.
- Artifacts that survive handoff to “future me” (specs, Storybook stories, docs).

If the user asks “make it feel better,” this skill’s output is: **taste + craft applied to code**.

**Clarifying brand identity request**

The user requests a brand logo and identity kit without UI deliverables, which conflicts with this skill’s UI focus. I'll restate the objective and propose providing brand identity assets conceptually without UI, then ask if they want to proceed or switch focus. Because this is complex, I'll also offer to initiate an /interview-me to explore details systematically. Finally, I'll seek explicit permission before continuing.
thinking
**Confirming brand identity scope**

I'll clarify that the UI-UX-creative-coding skill handles UI deliverables and pure brand identity is an anti-pattern here. I'll ask if they want a non-UI brand kit concept with deliverables like logo system, color palette, typography, and usage guidelines, noting it will be conceptual only. I'll also highlight that before producing the kit, relevant standards and rules will be reviewed, and no dependencies will be added without approval.
codex
Objective: you want a brand logo + full identity kit with **no UI deliverables**.  
Note: the `ui-ux-creative-coding` skill is UI-focused and flags pure brand identity as an anti‑pattern; I can still help, but it will be a **brand system spec** only (no UI code).

Plan (if you want to proceed):
1) Run /interview-me to lock scope, audience, tone, and usage constraints.
2) Produce a brand strategy snapshot (positioning, personality, differentiators).
3) Define the logo system (wordmark + mark + clearspace + sizing + misuse).
4) Build the identity kit (color, type, grid, imagery, voice, accessibility).
5) Deliver export specs + usage checklist (no UI deliverables).

Next step: decide whether to run /interview-me for this brand‑only request.

Should I use /interview-me to explore this systematically?
