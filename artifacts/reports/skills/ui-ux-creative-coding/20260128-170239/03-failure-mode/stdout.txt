Objective: you want a brand logo + full identity kit with **no UI deliverables**.  
Note: the `ui-ux-creative-coding` skill is UI-focused and flags pure brand identity as an anti‑pattern; I can still help, but it will be a **brand system spec** only (no UI code).

Plan (if you want to proceed):
1) Run /interview-me to lock scope, audience, tone, and usage constraints.
2) Produce a brand strategy snapshot (positioning, personality, differentiators).
3) Define the logo system (wordmark + mark + clearspace + sizing + misuse).
4) Build the identity kit (color, type, grid, imagery, voice, accessibility).
5) Deliver export specs + usage checklist (no UI deliverables).

Next step: decide whether to run /interview-me for this brand‑only request.

Should I use /interview-me to explore this systematically?
