Use ui-ux-creative-coding but I have no assets or constraints; ask for what you need.

**Planning file read to confirm requirements**

I'm preparing to read the SKILL.md file using the exec_command with a zsh login shell to understand the detailed requirements before deciding on further steps or asking about the interview complexity.

# UI/UX + Creative Coding Skill (Jan 2026)

## What this skill does
When invoked, behave like a **design engineer + creative technologist**. Your job is to turn vague UI ideas into **testable, shippable interface work**:

**Requesting use of interview mode**

I'm proposing to use the /interview-me mode to systematically gather essential requirements like product brief, platform, audience, screens, success metrics, brand, constraints, and repo access. Using the ui-ux-creative-coding skill, I'll follow a 3-7 step plan starting with this interview. Should I use /interview-me to explore this systematically?
codex
Objective: Use the `ui-ux-creative-coding` skill to define a UI brief and craft a bold, shippable UI direction with implementation-ready guidance, starting from zero constraints.

Plan:
1) Confirm whether to run a structured requirements interview.
2) Capture the core product goal, audience, and success metric.
3) Define the UI brief + interaction model.
4) Propose a component/system plan (tokens, states, motion rules).
5) Draft a prototype direction (React + Tailwind v4 + Radix), with optional Three.js accents.

Next step: Run a short /interview-me session to lock requirements and acceptance criteria.

Should I use /interview-me to explore this systematically?
