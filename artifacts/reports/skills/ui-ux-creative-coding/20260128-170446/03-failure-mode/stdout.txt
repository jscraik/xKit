## When to use
This skill is for UI/UX creative coding and shippable interface work. Your request is a pure brand identity task (logo + identity kit, no UI), which is an explicit anti-pattern for this skill. I can still help, but I will switch to a brand-identity workflow (no UI deliverables) and call out any assumptions.

## Inputs
Objective: Create a brand logo and a full identity kit with no UI deliverables.  
Missing essentials I need to avoid guessing:
- Brand name, tagline (if any), and legal entity name
- Audience + category (what you do, who it’s for)
- Positioning + differentiators (why you, why now)
- Brand personality (3–5 adjectives)
- Must-keep elements (colors, symbols, legacy marks) or hard “don’ts”

Plan (3–7 steps, single-threaded):
1) Capture a concise brand brief and constraints.
2) Generate 2–3 logo concept directions with rationale.
3) Select one direction and refine into primary + secondary marks.
4) Define core identity kit (color, type, spacing, grid, clearspace showings).
5) Produce usage rules + do/don’t examples (no UI).

## Outputs
I will deliver a brand-only identity kit (no UI):
- Logo system: primary mark, secondary/stacked, symbol-only, monochrome
- Color palette: primary, secondary, accent, neutrals + usage guidance
- Typography system: headline + body + fallbacks
- Spacing + clearspace rules, minimum size, and safe use
- Brand voice + tone summary
- Usage do/don’t examples (still non-UI)
- File list + export guidance (SVG, PNG, PDF)

Assumptions I will make if you don’t provide details:
- I’ll propose a neutral, modern identity aligned to your stated category.
- I’ll avoid tropes unless you request them.

## Next step
Do you want me to proceed with a short brand brief interview (yes/no)?
