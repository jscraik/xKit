## When to use
Objective: design a new settings panel for a Tauri app with motion polish using the ui-ux-creative-coding skill, while complying with your gold-standard gates and repo rules.  
Plan (3–7 steps):  
1) Load required instruction files (standards, engineering guidance, tooling, checklist, work rules, codestyle, user profile).  
2) Read the skill templates (assets) and align a UI brief + component plan + motion spec.  
3) Draft tokens + motion + component specs for the settings panel.  
4) Propose implementation file plan and verification checklist.  
5) (If code changes requested) implement minimal patch + stories and list verify commands.

## Inputs
Blocked: I cannot read required files under `/Users/jamiecraik/.codex/*` due to sandbox access limits.  
Required by your rules before any significant task:  
- `/Users/jamiecraik/.codex/instructions/standards.md`  
- `/Users/jamiecraik/.codex/instructions/engineering-guidance.md`  
- `/Users/jamiecraik/.codex/instructions/tooling.md`  
- `/Users/jamiecraik/.codex/instructions/README.checklist.md`  
- `/Users/jamiecraik/.codex/instructions/work-rules.md`  
- `/Users/jamiecraik/.codex/instructions/CODESTYLE.md`  
- `/Users/jamiecraik/.codex/USER_PROFILE.md`  
- `/Users/jamiecraik/.codex/USER_PROFILE.detail.md`

## Outputs
Once unblocked, I will produce (per skill contract):  
- UI brief (from `assets/design-brief.md`)  
- Component plan  
- Motion plan (from `assets/motion-spec.yml`)  
- Tokens plan (from `assets/tokens.json`)  
- Implementation plan (paths, APIs, a11y/perf notes)  
- Micro‑playbook  
- Verification notes (from `assets/acceptance-checklist.md`)

## Next step
Can you provide those `.codex` instruction files (paste here or copy into `/Users/jamiecraik/dev/agent-skills`) so I can proceed?
