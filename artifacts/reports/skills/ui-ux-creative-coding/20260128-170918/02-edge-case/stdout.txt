## When to use
Objective: apply `ui-ux-creative-coding` to define and implement a shippable UI direction and component work, starting from zero assets/constraints.

## Inputs
Please confirm these so I can lock scope and avoid rework:
- What are we designing (screen/flow/component), and the primary user task?
- Platform + stack (Tauri desktop vs web, React/Vite, Tailwind v4, Radix, etc.).
- Audience + tone (e.g., pro tool, consumer, playful, serious).
- Success criteria (“done means…”), plus any required states (loading/error/empty/disabled).
- Brand direction (even 2–3 adjectives) or competitors you want to outclass.
- Any constraints on time, performance, or accessibility targets (e.g., WCAG AA).

## Outputs
Plan (3–7 steps):
1) Draft a concise UI brief with goals, users, success metrics, and constraints.  
2) Define tokens + component system (states, variants, a11y).  
3) Create 2–3 visual/motion directions and pick one with rationale.  
4) Produce the component + motion plans with Tailwind v4/Radix implementation notes.  
5) Provide a micro‑playbook and verification checklist for a11y/perf/visual regression.

## Next step
Should I use /interview-me to explore this systematically? (yes/no)
