## When to use
This skill is for UI direction + implementation. A pure brand identity kit (logo + guidelines, no UI deliverables) is an explicit anti‑pattern for this skill, so I should switch to a brand‑identity workflow instead of UI craft.

## Inputs
Objective (restated): Create a brand logo and full identity kit with no UI deliverables.
Plan (3–7 steps):
1) Run a brief discovery to lock brand essence, audience, and constraints.
2) Define brand strategy pillars (positioning, personality, tone, values).
3) Create logo directions (wordmark + symbol + lockups) with rationale.
4) Build the visual system (color, type, grid, spacing, imagery, patterns, icon style).
5) Write usage guidelines (do/don’t, sizing, clear space, contrast).
6) Package a deliverable kit (markdown brand book + asset list).

## Outputs
- Brand brief + positioning
- Logo system (wordmark/symbol/lockups, mono/1‑color variants)
- Color palette with accessibility notes
- Typography system (primary/secondary, hierarchy rules)
- Layout/grid + spacing rules
- Iconography + illustration style
- Imagery/texture/pattern guidelines
- Brand voice + messaging examples
- “Do/Don’t” usage guidance
- Deliverable index (files to export/create)

## Next step
Should I use /interview-me to explore this systematically?
