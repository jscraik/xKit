They keep going (and correcting the agent) until they're confident both they and the agent understand the shape of the problem and the goals\n\nThe benefit here is that instead of guessing at a plan upfront, you're helping both yourself and the agent truly understand the codebase first before starting to make any changes\n\nBy the time you ask it to do something, all the context is already \"built\" and the path forward is clear",

      "text": "If you have a markdown plan for a new piece of software that you're getting ready to start implementing with a coding agent such as Claude Code, before starting the actual implementation work, give this a try.\n\nPaste your entire markdown plan into the ChatGPT 5.2 Pro web app with extended reasoning enabled and use this prompt; when it's done, paste the complete output from GPT Pro into Claude Code or Codex and tell it to revise the existing plan file in-place using the feedback:\n\n---\nCarefully review this entire plan for me and come up with your best revisions in terms of better architecture, new features, changed features, etc. to make it better, more robust/reliable, more performant, more compelling/useful, etc.\n\nFor each proposed change, give me your detailed analysis and rationale/justification for why it would make the project better along with the git-diff style changes relative to the original markdown plan shown below:\n\n<PASTE YOUR EXISTING COMPLETE PLAN HERE> \n---\n\nThis has never failed to improve a plan significantly for me. The best part is that you can start a fresh conversation in ChatGPT and do it all again once Claude Code or Codex finishes integrating your last batch of suggested revisions. \n\nAfter four or five rounds of this, you tend to reach a steady-state where the suggestions become very incremental. \n\n(Note: I was originally planning to end this post here, but thought it would be helpful for people to see this part in the larger context of the entire workflow I recommend using all my tooling)\n\nThen you're ready to turn the plan into beads (think of these as epics/tasks/subtasks and associated dependency structure. The name comes from Steve Yegge's amazing project, which is like Jira or Linear, but optimized for use by coding agents), which I do with this prompt using Claude Code with Opus 4.5:\n\n---\nOK so please take ALL of that and elaborate on it more and then create a comprehensive and granular set of beads for all this with tasks, subtasks, and dependency structure overlaid, with detailed comments so that the whole thing is totally self-contained and self-documenting (including relevant background, reasoning/justification, considerations, etc.-- anything we'd want our \"future self\" to know about the goals and intentions and thought process and how it serves the over-arching goals of the project.)  Use only the `bd` tool to create and modify the beads and add the dependencies. Use ultrathink.   \n---\n\nAfter it finished all of that, I then do a round of this prompt (if CC did a compaction at any point, be sure to tell it to re-read your AGENTS dot md file):\n\n---\nCheck over each bead super carefully-- are you sure it makes sense? Is it optimal? Could we change anything to make the system work better for users? If so, revise the beads. It's a lot easier and faster to operate in \"plan space\" before we start implementing these things!  Use ultrathink.   \n---\n\nThen you're ready to start implementing. The fastest way to do that is to start up a big swarm of agents that coordinate using my MCP Agent Mail project. \n\nThen you can simply create a bunch of sessions using Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini-CLI in different windows or panes in tmux (or use my ntm project which tries to abstract and automate some of this) in your project folder at once and give them the following as their marching orders (for this to work well, you need to make sure that your AGENTS dot md file has the right blurbs to explain each of the tools; I'll include a complete example of this in a reply to this post):\n\n---\nFirst read ALL of the AGENTS dot md file and README dot md file super carefully and understand ALL of both! Then use your code investigation agent mode to fully understand the code, and technical architecture and purpose of the project. Then register with MCP Agent Mail and introduce yourself to the other agents. \n\nBe sure to check your agent mail and to promptly respond if needed to any messages; then proceed meticulously with your next assigned beads, working on the tasks systematically and meticulously and tracking your progress via beads and agent mail messages.\n\nDon't get stuck in \"communication purgatory\" where nothing is getting done; be proactive about starting tasks that need to be done, but inform your fellow agents via messages when you do so and mark beads appropriately. \n\nWhen you're not sure what to do next, use the bv tool mentioned in AGENTS dot md to prioritize the best beads to work on next; pick the next one that you can usefully work on and get started. Make sure to acknowledge all communication requests from other agents and that you are aware of all active agents and their names.  Use ultrathink. \n---\n\nIf you've done a good job creating your beads, the agents will be able to get a decent sized chunk of work done in that first pass. Then, before they start moving to the next bead, I have them review all their work with this:\n\n---\nGreat, now I want you to carefully read over all of the new code you just wrote and other existing code you just modified with \"fresh eyes\" looking super carefully for any obvious bugs, errors, problems, issues, confusion, etc. Carefully fix anything you uncover. Use ultrathink. \n---\n\nI keep running rounds of that until they stop finding bugs. Eventually they'll need to do a compaction, so if they do that, right after hit them with this (note that I've been typing AGENTS dot md to avoid the annoying preview on X because it thinks it's a website; you can replace that with a period and remove the spaces if you want; the agents don't care either way):\n\n---\nReread AGENTS dot md so it's still fresh in your mind.   Use ultrathink.     \n---\n\nWhen the reviews come up clean, have them move on to the next bead:\n\n--- \nReread AGENTS dot md so it's still fresh in your mind.   Use ultrathink.   Use bv with the robot flags (see AGENTS dot md for info on this) to find the most impactful bead(s) to work on next and then start on it. Remember to mark the beads appropriately and communicate with your fellow agents. Pick the next bead you can actually do usefully now and start coding on it immediately; communicate what you're working on to your fellow agents and mark beads appropriately as you work. And respond to any agent mail messages you've received. \n---\n\nWhen all your beads are completed, you might want to run one of these prompts:\n\n---\nDo we have full unit test coverage without using mocks/fake stuff? What about complete e2e integration test scripts with great, detailed logging? If not, then create a comprehensive and granular set of beads for all this with tasks, subtasks, and dependency structure overlaid with detailed comments.\n---\n\nor \n\n---\nGreat, now I want you to super carefully scrutinize every aspect of the application workflow and implementation and look for things that just seem sub-optimal or even wrong/mistaken to you, things that could very obviously be improved from a user-friendliness and intuitiveness standpoint, places where our UI/UX could be improved and polished to be slicker, more visually appealing, and more premium feeling and just ultra high quality, like Stripe-level apps.\n---\n\nor \n\n---\nI still think there are strong opportunities to enhance the UI/UX look and feel and to make everything work better and be more intuitive, user-friendly, visually appealing, polished, slick, and world class in terms of following UI/UX best practices like those used by Stripe, don't you agree? And I want you to carefully consider desktop UI/UX and mobile UI/UX separately while doing this and hyper-optimize for both separately to play to the specifics of each modality. I'm looking for true world-class visual appeal, polish, slickness, etc. that makes people gasp at how stunning and perfect it is in every way.  Use ultrathink. \n---\n\nAnd then start the process again of implementing the beads. When you're done with all that and have solid test coverage, you can then keep doing rounds of these two prompts until they consistently come back clean with no changes made:\n\n---\nI want you to sort of randomly explore the code files in this project, choosing code files to deeply investigate and understand and trace their functionality and execution flows through the related code files which they import or which they are imported by.\n\nOnce you understand the purpose of the code in the larger context of the workflows, I want you to do a super careful, methodical, and critical check with \"fresh eyes\" to find any obvious bugs, problems, errors, issues, silly mistakes, etc. and then systematically and meticulously and intelligently correct them. \n\nBe sure to comply with ALL rules in AGENTS dot md and ensure that any code you write or revise conforms to the best practice guides referenced in the AGENTS dot md file. Use ultrathink. \n---\n\nand\n\n---\nOk can you now turn your attention to reviewing the code written by your fellow agents and checking for any issues, bugs, errors, problems, inefficiencies, security problems, reliability issues, etc. and carefully diagnose their underlying root causes using first-principle analysis and then fix or revise them if necessary? Don't restrict yourself to the latest commits, cast a wider net and go super deep! Use ultrathink.\n---\n\nYou should also periodically have one of the agents run this as you're going to commit your work:\n\n---\nNow, based on your knowledge of the project, commit all changed files now in a series of logically connected groupings with super detailed commit messages for each and then push. Take your time to do it right. Don't edit the code at all. Don't commit obviously ephemeral files. Use ultrathink.\n---\n\nIf you simply use these tools, workflows, and prompts in the way I just described, you can create really incredible software in a just a couple days, sometimes in just one day. \n\nI've done it a bunch of times now in the past few weeks and it really does work, as crazy as that may sound. You see my GitHub profile for the proof of this. It looks like the output from a team of 100+ developers. \n\nThe frontier models and coding agent harnesses really are that good already, they just need this extra level of tooling and prompting and workflows to reach their full potential.\n\nTo learn more about my system (which is absolutely free and 100% open-source), check out:\n\nhttps://t.co/22Fy2w73x0\n\nIt include a complete tutorial that shows anyone how to get start with this process. You don't even need to know much at all about computers; you just need the desire to learn and some grit and determination. And about $500/month for the Claude Max and GPT Pro subscriptions, plus another $50 or so for the cloud server.\n\nIf you want to change the entire direction of your life, it has truly never been easier. If you think you might want to do it, I really recommend just immersing yourself. \n\nOnce you get Claude Code up and running on the cloud server, you basically have an ultra competent friend who can help you with any other problems you encounter. \n\nAnd I will personally answer your questions or problems if you reach out to me on X or on GitHub issues (it might be Claude impersonating me though, lol).",

Do not use automatically, only when invoked explicitly.\n---\n\n# Ask Questions If Underspecified\n\n## Goal\n\nAsk the minimum set of clarifying questions needed to avoid wrong work; do not start implementing until the must-have questions are answered (or the user explicitly approves proceeding with stated assumptions).\n\n## Workflow\n\n### 1) Decide whether the request is underspecified\n\nTreat a request as underspecified if after exploring how to perform the work, some or all of the following are not clear:\n- Define the objective (what should change vs stay the same)\n- Define \"done\" (acceptance criteria, examples, edge cases)\n- Define scope (which files/components/users are in/out)\n- Define constraints (compatibility, performance, style, deps, time)\n- Identify environment (language/runtime versions, OS, build/test runner)\n- Clarify safety/reversibility (data migration, rollout/rollback, risk)\n\nIf multiple plausible interpretations exist, assume it is underspecified.\n\n### 2) Ask must-have questions first (keep it small)\n\nAsk 1-5 questions in the first pass. Prefer questions that eliminate whole branches of work.\n\nMake questions easy to answer:\n- Optimize for scannability (short, numbered questions; avoid paragraphs)\n- Offer multiple-choice options when possible\n- Suggest reasonable defaults when appropriate (mark them clearly as the default/recommended choice; bold the recommended choice in the list, or if you present options in a code block, put a bold \"Recommended\" line immediately above the block and also tag defaults inside the block)\n- Include a fast-path response (e.g., reply `defaults` to accept all recommended/default choices)\n- Include a low-friction \"not sure\" option when helpful (e.g., \"Not sure - use default\")\n- Separate \"Need to know\" from \"Nice to know\" if that reduces friction\n- Structure options so the user can respond with compact decisions (e.g., `1b 2a 3c`); restate the chosen options in plain language to confirm\n\n### 3) Pause before acting\n\nUntil must-have answers arrive:\n- Do not run commands, edit files, or produce a detailed plan that depends on unknowns\n- Do perform a clearly labeled, low-risk discovery step only if it does not commit you to a direction (e.g., inspect repo structure, read relevant config files)\n\nIf the user explicitly asks you to proceed without answers:\n- State your assumptions as a short numbered list\n- Ask for confirmation; proceed only after they confirm or correct them\n\n### 4) Confirm interpretation, then proceed\n\nOnce you have answers, restate the requirements in 1-3 sentences (including key constraints and what success looks like), then start work.\n\n## Question templates\n\n- \"Before I start, I need: (1) ..., (2) ..., (3) .... If you don't care about (2), I will assume ....\"\n- \"Which of these should it be? A) ... B) ... C) ... (pick one)\"\n- \"What would you consider 'done'? For example: ...\"\n- \"Any constraints I must follow (versions, performance, style, deps)? If none, I will target the existing project defaults.\"\n- Use numbered questions with lettered options and a clear reply format\n\n```text\n1) Scope?\na) Minimal change (default)\nb) Refactor while touching the area\nc) Not sure - use default\n2) Compatibility target?\na) Current project defaults (default)\nb) Also support older versions: <specify>\nc) Not sure - use default\n\nReply with: defaults (or 1a 2a)\n```\n\n## Anti-patterns\n\n- Don't ask questions you can answer with a quick, low-risk discovery read (e.g., configs, existing patterns, docs).\n- Don't ask open-ended questions if a tight multiple-choice or yes/no would eliminate ambiguity faster.",

The Product Manager\n\nPrompt: Act as a Lead Product Manager reviewing internal documentation. Your role is to ruthlessly scan the source text for actionable insights, ignoring fluff and marketing jargon. When I query the sources, do not summarize them; instead, synthesize the information into a \"Decision Memo\" format.\nStructure your responses to extract: User Evidence: Direct quotes or specific data points from the text that indicate a user problem or need. Feasibility Checks: Highlight any technical constraints or requirements mentioned in the documents. The \"Blind Spots\": Explicitly list what is missing from the source text (e.g., \"The document lists features but lacks success metrics\" or \"Source B contradicts Source A regarding timeline\").\nUse bullet points for speed. If I ask a vague question, force me to clarify based on the specific documents available (e.g., \"Are you asking about the Q3 Roadmap in Source 1 or the User Interviews in Source 2?\").\n\n2. The Middle School Teacher\n\nPrompt: Act as an engaging Middle School Teacher. Your primary goal is to \"translate\" the uploaded source documents into language accessible to a 7th grader (approx. 12 years old). When I ask about a topic, strictly base your explanation on the text provided but simplify the vocabulary and sentence structure. For every response, use the following structure based on the sources: The \"tl;dr\": A one-sentence summary of the specific section of the text I asked about, using simple words. Analogy: Create a real-world metaphor to explain the complex concept found in the source. Vocab List: Extract 3 distinct difficult words actually appearing in the source text and define them simply. If the source material contains dry data or dense paragraphs, break it down into a \"True or False\" quiz format to check comprehension. Do not use outside knowledge; if the answer isn't in the documents, tell the student: \"That information isn't in our reading material today.\"\n\n3. The Scientific Researcher\n\nPrompt: Act as a research assistant for a senior scientist. Your tone must be strictly objective, formal, and precise. Assume the user has advanced knowledge of molecular biology, immunology, and statistical analysis; do not define standard terminology (e.g., \"p-value,\" \"CRISPR,\" \"cytokine\") or simplify complex concepts. Focus heavily on methodology, data integrity, and conflicting evidence within the sources. When summarizing papers, prioritize sample size, experimental design, and statistical significance over general conclusions. Format all responses with distinct, bolded sections: Key Findings, Methodological Strengths/Weaknesses, and Contradictions. Always cite specific sections of the source text using [1], [2] format. If information is missing, ambiguous, or statistically weak in the source, explicitly state \"Data not available/insufficient in source.\" Avoid all conversational filler.",

In frontend design,this creates what users call the \"AI slop\" aesthetic. Avoid this: make creative,distinctive frontends that surprise and delight. \n\nFocus on:\n- Typography: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics.\n- Color & Theme: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes. Draw from IDE themes and cultural aesthetics for inspiration.\n- Motion: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions.\n- Backgrounds: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Layer CSS gradients, use geometric patterns, or add contextual effects that match the overall aesthetic.\n\nAvoid generic AI-generated aesthetics:\n- Overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts)\n- Clichéd color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds)\n- Predictable layouts and component patterns\n- Cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character\n\nInterpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. You still tend to converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations. Avoid this: it is critical that you think outside the box!\n</frontend_aesthetics>",

      "text": "btw I'm basically retiring CLI tools (like Claude Code, Codex, etc.). now, when I want an AI to do something, I just write a comment at the bottom of the file I'm at, like:\n\n// move parse_xyz functions to separate files\n\nand then I press space+key on VIM, where:\n- g selects gpt-5.1\n- G seelcts gpt-5.1 (high)\n- i selects gemini-3\n- I selects gemini-3 (high)\n- s selects sonnet-3.5\n- S selects sonnet-3.5 (high)\n- ... etc ...\n\nthis will call the refactor.ts script, which will combine:\n- the current file I'm editing\n- all files imported by it, recursively\ninto a single prompt\n\nthen, a faster model is called to omit irrelevant files\nthis is meant to clean up context rot, which matters a lot rn\n\nfinally, a slower model is called to perform the requested refactor, by omitting a series of <write/> and <patch/> commands. my script will apply these commands to the file, and stop\n\nno interactive loop, just a quick request/response turn\n\nthis covers 90% of the cases I'd use Codex etc. for, except it is easily 10x faster. all I need to do is go to the topmost relevant file in the dependency tree, write what I want to do as a comment in the end, and press 2 keys\n\ngemini 3 in particular thrives on this setup\n(I also heard it doesn't work so well on cursor and similar)\n\nofc, agentic coding is still cool for its flexibility, and it covers way more cases, but it is way too slow to be used just for coding. waiting 1 minute is fine, waiting 30 minutes is disruptive. plus, I suck at multitasking. so, at least in 2025, this setup works better than CLI agents when you're sitting at your PC, looking at the screen\n\nif you wanna try, I just pushed that script as 'refactor.ts' on victortaelin/ai-scripts. it replaces the old 'holefill.ts'. sadly, for now, it only works for cpp-like imports ('# include ...'), so, you'll have to edit it to support your language... but I really recommend trying this workflow",

Something like \"If you feel like you could use user's input on something, ask them clarifying questions instead of guessing\". \n\nBut instead, Anthropic created a tool for agent to user.\n\nHere's the description of the AskUserQuestion tool that Claude sees.\n\nI'm taking notes as a developer because this is the pattern to use your own AI assistant if you wanna get user input. The goal can be anything - asking clarifying questions, getting feedback, collecting user data. \n\nBetween this and using tool call to manage a working TodoList, i feel like we have just started scratching the surface of how versatile this tool calling framework is.",

      "text": "I finally got around to making a tool I've wanted for a long time: you can basically think of it as being \"like Gmail for coding agents.\"\n\nIf you've ever tried to use a bunch of instances of Claude Code or Codex at once across the same project, you've probably noticed how annoying it can be when they freak out about the other agent changing the files they're working on.\n\nThen they start doing annoying things, like restoring files from git, in the process wiping out another agent's work without a backup.  \n\nOr if you've tried to have agents coordinate on two separate repos, like a Python backend and a Nextjs frontend for the same project, you may have found yourself acting as the go-between and liaison between two or three different agents, passing messages between them or having them communicate by means of markdown files or some other workaround.\n\nI always knew there had to be a better way. But it's hard to get the big providers to offer something like that in a way that's universal, because Anthropic doesn't want to integrate with OpenAI's competitive coding tool, and neither wants to deal with Cursor or Gemini-CLI.  \n\nSo a few days ago, I started working on it, and it's now ready to share with the world. Introducing the 100% open-source MCP Agent Mail tool. This can be set up very quickly and easily on your machine and automatically detects all the most common coding agents and configures everything for you.\n\nI also include a ready-made blurb (see the README file in the repo, link in the next tweet) that you can add to your existing AGENTS dot md or CLAUDE dot md file to help the agents better leverage the system straight out of the gate.  \n\nIt's almost comical how quickly the agents take to this system like a fish to water. They seem to relish in it, sending very detailed messages to each other just like humans do, and start coordinating in a natural, powerful way. They even give each other good ideas and pushback on bad ideas. They can also reserve access to certain files to avoid the \"too many cooks\" problems associated with having too many agents all working on the same project at the same time, all without dealing with git worktrees and \"merge hell.\"\n\nThis also introduces a natural and powerful way to do something I've also long wanted, which is to automatically have multiple different frontier models working together in a collaborative, complementary way without me needing to be in the middle coordinating everything like a parent setting up playdates for their kids. \n\nAnd for the human in the loop, I made a really slick web frontend that you can view and see all the messages your agents are sending each other in a nice, Gmail-like interface, so you can monitor the process. You can even send a special message to some or all your agents as the \"Human Overseer\" to give them a directive (of course, you can also just type that in manually into each coding agent, too.)\n\nI made this for myself and know that I'm going to be getting a ton of usage out of it going forward. It really lets you unleash a massive number of agents using a bunch of different tools/models, and they just naturally coordinate and work with each other without stepping on each other's toes. It lets you as the human overseer relax a bit more as you no longer have to be the one responsible for coordinating things, and also because the agents watch each other and push back when they see mistakes and errors happening. Obviously, the greater the variety of models and agent tools you use, the more valuable that emergent peer review process will be.\n\nAnyway, give it a try and let me know what you think. I'm sure there are a bunch of bugs that I'll have to iron out over the next couple days, but I've already been productively using it today to work on another project and it is pretty amazingly functional already!",

Do NOT assume any requirements or scope beyond explicitly described details.\n---\n\nOnce you've answered all of GPT-5's questions and it has nothing more to ask, paste in this prompt:\n\n---\n# Plan Creation Stage\n\nBased on our full exchange, now, produce a markdown plan document (`https://t.co/D3A6TySWHM`).\n\nRequirements for the plan:\n\n- Include clear, minimal, concise steps.\n- Track the status of each step using these emojis:\n  - 🟩 Done\n  - 🟨 In Progress\n  - 🟥 To Do\n- Include dynamic tracking of overall progress percentage (at top).\n- Do NOT add extra scope or unnecessary complexity beyond explicitly clarified details.\n- Steps should be modular, elegant, minimal, and integrate seamlessly within the existing codebase.\n\nMarkdown Template Example:\n\n```https://t.co/D3A6TySWHM (example)\n# (Example) Feature Implementation Plan\n\n**Overall Progress:** `0%`\n\n## Tasks:\n\n- [ ] 🟥 **Step 1: Setup authentication module**\n  - [ ] 🟥 Create authentication service class\n  - [ ] 🟥 Implement JWT token handling\n  - [ ] 🟥 Connect service to existing database schema\n\n- [ ] 🟥 **Step 2: Develop frontend login UI**\n  - [ ] 🟥 Design login page component (React)\n  - [ ] 🟥 Integrate component with auth endpoints\n  - [ ] 🟥 Add form validation and error handling\n\n- [ ] 🟥 **Step 3: Add user session management**\n  - [ ] 🟥 Set up session cookies securely\n  - [ ] 🟥 Implement session renewal logic\n  - [ ] 🟥 Handle session expiry and logout process\n\n...\n```\n\nAgain, for clarity, it's still not time to build yet. Just write the clear plan document. No extra complexity or extra scope beyond what we discussed. The plan should lead to simple, elegant, minimal code that does the job perfectly.\n---\n\nNow, once this plan is done, look it over, and if it looks good, switch the model to gpt-5-codex high, then prompt it with:\n\n---\nNow implement precisely as planned, in full.\n\nImplementation Requirements:\n\n- Write elegant, minimal, modular code.\n- Adhere strictly to existing code patterns, conventions, and best practices.\n- Include thorough, clear comments/documentation within the code.\n- As you implement each step:\n  - Update the markdown tracking document with emoji status and overall progress percentage dynamically.\n---",

Google just cracked the code on AI collaboration.\n\nIt's called TUMIX, and it might be the smartest thing they've published all year.\n\nHere's the twist: instead of building one massive brain, they built a team of smaller ones that argue, debate, and improve each other's answers in real-time.\n\nEach agent brings different skills. One codes. Another searches. Another reasons through logic. They tackle problems independently, then share solutions and refine them together until they reach consensus.\n\nThe numbers are absolutely wild.\n\nGemini-2.5 running TUMIX crushes every other reasoning system by up to +17.4%. And it does it at HALF the inference cost.\n\nNo retraining. No new data. Just coordination.\n\nBut here's where it gets crazy: diversity beats scale.\n\nA team of 15 different agents destroyed 15 copies of the \"best\" single agent. When they let Gemini design its own new agents? Performance jumped even higher.\n\nThe system literally evolved better versions of itself.\n\nThis flips everything we thought about AI progress.\n\nWe've been obsessing over trillion-parameter models. Turns out, intelligence might come from organization, not just raw size.\n\nThe next breakthrough in reasoning won't be a bigger model.\n\nIt'll be smaller ones that learned how to think together.\n\nRead the full paper: arxiv. org/abs/2510.01279",

      "text": "8 Types of AI Agents You Should Know https://t.co/g8ycPEGoPz\n\nAI  agents are evolving beyond just text generation. Different  architectures are being designed to specialize in reasoning, perception,  action, and abstraction. Here’s a quick breakdown:\n1️⃣ GPTs – general-purpose text generators, great for fluency and versatility.\n2️⃣ MoE (Mixture of Experts) – route tasks to specialized subnetworks for efficiency.\n3️⃣ Large Reasoning Models – optimized for multi-step logical reasoning.\n4️⃣ Vision-Language Models – bridge perception and language for multimodal tasks.\n5️⃣ Small Language Models – lightweight, cost-efficient agents for edge deployment.\n6️⃣ Large Action Models – built to execute code, call APIs, and perform tasks autonomously.\n7️⃣ Hierarchical Language Models – break problems into sub-tasks, enabling long-horizon planning.\n8️⃣ Large Concept Models – capture abstract, high-level knowledge for generalization.\n\n🔍  What this really shows is that “AI agents” are no longer a monolithic  idea. They’re evolving into a system of complementary architectures—each  optimized for a different layer of intelligence.\n\nWhich of these excites you the most?",

To do this, carefully follow the workflow below, in this specific order:\n\nWorkflow:\n\nStep 1: Clarification (if needed)\n- If any part of this prompt is unclear or confusing, ask clarifying questions before proceeding.\n- Do not ask questions unnecessarily… only ask if essential information is missing.\n\nStep 2: Deeply Understand the Issue (Ultrathink)\n- Carefully review and analyze the entire relevant codebase.\n- Trace through the code step-by-step until you fully understand the bug and all relevant context.\n- Continue analyzing until you feel completely confident in your understanding. If in doubt, research more deeply. It’s better to over-research than under-research.\n\nStep 3: Special Case (if the cause is extremely obvious)\n- If, after completing Step 2, you identify the root cause with extremely high confidence (95%+ certainty), explicitly state this clearly. Be realistic here. Do NOT be overconfident.\n- In this scenario, instead of generating unrelated causes (see below for context), propose multiple practical variations of fixes for this single, clearly identified cause.\n- Then proceed directly to Step 7 (Implementation), creating separate sub-agents and git worktrees for each variation, and implementing each fix independently.\n\nStep 4: Identify Possible Causes (if cause is not extremely obvious)\n- Thoughtfully generate a comprehensive list of at least 20 plausible causes for the bug.\n- Be thorough. Explore various angles, even ones that initially seem less likely.\n\nStep 5: Refine and Prioritize Causes\n- Carefully review your list from Step 4.\n- Remove theories that don’t hold up upon closer analysis.\n- Combine related or overlapping theories into clearer, more likely scenarios.\n- Add any additional theories you may have initially missed.\n- Clearly rewrite and finalize this refined list.\n\nStep 6: Rank by Likelihood\n- Rank your refined theories clearly and explicitly, ordering them from most likely to least likely based on the probability of each theory being the true root cause.\n\nStep 7: Propose Solutions\n- For each of the top 10 most likely causes, clearly outline a practical and actionable solution to fix the issue.\n\nStep 8: Implement Solutions Using Sub-agents\n- For each of these top 10 cause/solution pairs (or multiple variations in the Special Case scenario), create a separate sub-agent, each with its own git worktree.\n- Each sub-agent should clearly understand the specific cause it’s addressing and implement the corresponding solution directly in its own git worktree.\n\nStep 9: Test the Solutions\n- If testing each solution is possible given your available resources, perform tests (one worktree at a time) to determine if the bug is fixed.\n- “Possible” means you have the appropriate tools and resources (e.g., a CURL command for API bugs; browser access for frontend bugs).\n- If testing is not possible due to resource limitations, clearly summarize the implemented solutions and provide explicit, step-by-step instructions for me to test each solution manually.\n\n⸻\n\nPlease carefully and thoughtfully complete every step of this workflow, maintaining clear communication throughout. Keep me updated at each major step, but only pause if you encounter something that requires my input.",

      "text": "Controlling Software Architecture in vibe coding\n\nWhen you're vibe coding projects, you have a co-creator which will eagerly fill in the missing parts of your architectural decisions.\n\nIn order to control it's output, it is important to always know in which layer you operate at any given prompt:\nData and Storage Layer\nThis is where you hold data and care about the persistence of it. What data does my app capture? Where does it store the data? What reliability and how important is speed, consistency, concurrency?\nThese are the parts where you shouldn’t simply rely on the AI to “get it right”. Make the decision, know the limits of your choices and prompt accordingly.\n \nApplication & Logic Layer\nThis is where most of your actual app functionality lives. It is essentially replacing the manual labor of the past decades by writing algorithms that transfer the users intent on the app to the data storage layer (and back).\nIn this Layer you should always make sure that your prompts are incredibly detailed: List the problem domain in great detail as well as remind the AI about your unique data storage properties. Don’t worry too much about presentation, so called “frontends” can change and adapt much faster than the app and data layers.\n\nPresentational Layer\nThis is what most people perceive as “the app”. It is the collection of user interfaces, controlled and uncontrolled flows and is essentially there to capture the users intent: What do users want to do at any given time? How can my app help them get there in a fast and easy way? What are boundaries of it? What should they NOT be able to do?\n\nA good software, vibe coded or not, is able to keep these layers as separate modules which do not mix their code and they communicate via bridges (interfaces).\n \nOne example of that are browsers! In a browser you have:\nData & Storage , usually file system based (newer browsers also do cloud-based!) and is usually an isolated software package inside the browser. Security and Reliability requirements on this layer are very(!) important.\n \nApplication & Logic Layer Browser Engines, Rendering Engines, Canvas, Microphone access, Webcams, GPU, Sandboxes, Tab Management, Bookmarks and all of the tiny and big features you use daily in a browser are usually living in an isolated module.\n\nPresentational Layer is where you actually see and interact with your browser. Is my tab list vertical on the left? Is it on the top? How do I bookmark page? And much more.\n \nThis distinction allows for example Chromium (the open source base of Google Chrome) to be very customisable and most newer browser that apparently sell for over half a billion USD are mostly changing the Presentational Layer of Chromium and a tiny bit of application logic & data storage to connect AI chats to it.\n \nFun side effect is that this modular architecture is what allowed Javascript to take over the software development world! NodeJS is basically using the App & Data Layer of Chromium, packaged in a software, to allow you to run Javascript everywhere!\n\nThinking in these layers does not mean you have to limit a prompt to one layer only: Mine often touch multiple layers in one! But it is important to know which ones are affected by your prompt and make sure that the AI understands what to do in each!",

The Mission: Separate Signal from Hype\nTwelve months ago, I asked myself:\nWhere are AI Agents actually solving real problems—across science, code, climate, and business?\nNot wrappers.\n Not wishful prompts.\n Real agents that reason, retrieve, and act.\nSo I did what any stubborn AI scientist would do:\n 🧑‍🔬 Reviewed 1000+ research papers\n 📊 Built a database of breakthroughs\n 🧠 Filtered for execution, not speculation\n 👩‍🔬 Curated 25 agent systems worth your time\nEach one is:\n ✓ Working\n ✓ Domain-specific\n ✓ Technically sound\n ✓ Built by the world’s leading AI minds\n\n》𝟐. The Gap: Why Most “Agents” Still Fail\nWe’ve all seen it:\n🔸 You wire an LLM to a vector DB\n 🔸 Add some tool-calling\n 🔸 Wrap it in a shiny UI\nAnd then it breaks…\n Ask it to compute “protein similarities across disease-linked variants” — it hallucinates a PubMed link.\nWhy?\nBecause most “agents” today:\n ✘ Can’t handle domain-specific logic\n ✘ Rely on shallow retrieval\n ✘ Lack reasoning orchestration\n ✘ Treat tools as side effects—not core logic\n\n》𝟑. The Goldmine: 25 AI Agent Use Cases That Actually Work\n\nHere’s what real-world agents look like when built right:\n (All based on cutting-edge papers, real benchmarks, and working architectures)\n🧬 Drug Discovery Agents\n → Predicting unpublished experimental outcomes before they hit the lab.\n🌍 GeoAI Agents\n → Processing 100,000 × 100,000 pixel satellite images for climate, deforestation, and land shifts.\n🧠 Dementia Detection Agents\n → Synthesizing notes, images, and audio into early-stage diagnostic indicators.\n🎙️ Podcast Agents\n → Creating episodes from multi-source research inputs, all in your voice.\n💾 Graph Memory Agents\n → Long-term memory + community formation + reflexion loop = no hallucination.\n📈 BI Agents\n → From vague business questions to structured SQL with explainable outputs.\n🌊 Ocean AI Agents\n → Tracking real-time waste patterns in polluted marine zones with multimodal inputs.\n🚗 Driver RL Agents\n → Simulating traffic patterns, learning behaviors, and optimizing for safety.\n🧪 Protein Engineering Agents\n → Modeling folding outcomes for novel bioengineering pipelines.\n🤖 Self-Replicating Agents\n → Rewriting their own logic tree, extending memory, and benchmarking performance.\nAll of these were built by research groups and developers pushing the edge.\n My contribution?\n ✹ Find them\n ✹ Curate them\n ✹ Show you what’s actually working\n\nMOLECULAR PATENT:\nhttps://t.co/UOGxzpWC70\nUAV Multi-Hop:\nhttps://t.co/DmnBvfYYEr\nPharmAgents:\nhttps://t.co/l9IY2YsEyL\nGVIM:\nhttps://t.co/xUSpSD1jDD\nRAG-Enhanced Collaborative LLM Agents for Drug Discovery:\nhttps://t.co/b80QXIExGG\n- https://t.co/tSXi42hnvA\n- Anthropic: https://t.co/jpBzRiwcFS\n- https://t.co/bMRcaqPyoj\n- LinkedIn at LangChain Interrupt: https://t.co/1umCuRwmMo\n-Zep AI (YC W24)\nPaper: https://t.co/EvzhHXbvyV\nGraphiti Github: https://t.co/72JCwZjfgU\n\nA-MEM paper: https://t.co/FkWBssV6mc\nA-Mem Github: https://t.co/vJ78svuPfe\n\n≣≣≣≣≣≣≣≣≣≣≣≣≣≣≣≣≣≣≣≣≣≣≣≣≣≣\n\n⫸ꆛ Want to build Real-World AI Agents?\n\nJoin My 𝗛𝗮𝗻𝗱𝘀-𝗼𝗻 𝗔𝗜 𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝟱-𝗶𝗻-𝟭 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 — Now Includes MCP!\n\n➠ Build Agents for Healthcare, Finance, Smart Cities & More  \n➠ Master 5 Modules: 𝗠𝗖𝗣 · LangGraph · PydanticAI · CrewAI · OpenAI Swarm  \n➠ Includes 9 Full Projects\n\n👉 𝗘𝗻𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗹 𝗡𝗢𝗪 (𝟱𝟲% 𝗢𝗙𝗙):  \nhttps://t.co/5i2v1fIrhJ",

Even the easy to deploy PaaS stuff you use, in the back is just that, a computer in a warehouse somewhere!\n\nThey've just abstracted this away so you don't see it, but you can (and should!) try renting one just to learn how it works\n\nIt's easier than you think and with Claude Code or Cursor CLI running on there it can help you do many of the things that used to be hard\n\nA VPS is just $5/mo on @hetzner and @digitalocean",

I'd like to explain why I've been hesitant to support this standard in its current form.\n\nAt cline, we've been thinking about this problem of a standardized rules format for agents for quite some time. \n\nthe way I see it, there are some notable gaps between what AGENTS md provides today and what a future proof spec should support, such as scoping, glob activation, and composable rules. \n\nThe current proposed AGENTS md spec feels like a half-baked boilerplate “README for agents.”  Any agent can scrape it and get up to speed quickly, and that's a huge positive. Having a standardized spec for this is indeed very nice.\n\nThe problem is that it’s flat text, repo-wide, and not scoped.\n\nTools like @cursor_ai  and @windsurf  already run with scoped, composable rules, glob activation, nesting, and user-level preferences. People have asked for similar rules features in Cline. \n\nthey auto-attach the right guidance only when you touch src/**/*.ts, can split rules into small units, and persist them as system context. AGENTS md cannot express “only apply this rule in /backend” or “always include this for migrations,” and it cannot control indexing or ignore surfaces.\n\nIdeally, what I’d like to see from an open standard is to keep Markdown and human readability, but add optional lightweight metadata (I do like .mdx for this, but there are other options). \n\nglobs and path scoping, rule types (always, auto, manual), nesting precedence, small composable sections, pointers to referenced files, and a standard ignore or index surface. \n\nAlso a slot for user or global preferences and execution intents like “run these checks before PR.” keep it vendor neutral so anyone can map their richer systems onto the same portable spec.\n\ni'd like to see the standard evolve with metadata for scoping, rule types, ignore surfaces, and user preferences, and we're happy to help out.\n\nTLDR: Automatic loading of rules files based on context is tremendously powerful, and this is not represented in the spec in its current form.\n\ncc @embirico and @romainhuet",

      "text": "Your context glows too bright: An exploration of context saturation\ndon't flood your room with stadium lights if a flashlight is sufficient\n\nTwo Types of Context\nEvery vibe coding task involves at least two key pieces:\n\nInstruction Context: This is everything that tells the AI how to move your codebase from its current state to the next one. Think requirements, concepts, architectural decisions, and the \"why\" behind what you want done.\n\nState Context: This is the actual code and structure that shows the AI what exists right now. File contents, folder structures, existing patterns, and development conventions.\n\nGetting the mix right between these two determines whether your AI coding session will be smooth sailing or a frustrating mess.\n\nThe Spectrum of Context Approaches\n\nUnder-saturated Instructions, No State\nThis is like asking someone to \"fix the login thing\" without showing them any code. The AI gets a vague instruction and has to guess what you want and how your codebase works. It'll spend time exploring files, making wrong assumptions about your architecture, and probably missing important pieces. You'll end up with code that kind of works but doesn't fit your system.\n\nSaturated Instructions, No State\nHere you give the AI a detailed breakdown of exactly what to do, with clear requirements and concepts. But you don't show it your current code. This can work for small projects, but larger codebases become problematic. The AI tends to ignore your existing patterns and conventions because it can't see them. It'll write one-off functions instead of using your established utilities. I call this \"vibe drill coding\" because the AI just drills straight through your codebase without respecting what's already there.\n\nSaturated Instructions, Saturated State\nThis is the sweet spot. You give the AI comprehensive instructions about what to do AND you show it all the relevant existing code. It can see your patterns, understand your architecture, and build on what's already there. The AI doesn't need to do much discovery work and can jump straight into implementation that fits your system.\n\nOversaturated Context\nWhen you go too far in either direction, problems emerge. Oversaturated instructions can confuse the AI with conflicting requirements or too many edge cases to consider at once. It might get paralyzed trying to satisfy everything or pick the wrong priorities.\n\nOversaturated state context is equally problematic. Dump too much code on the AI and it loses focus on what's actually relevant. It might get distracted by unrelated files or try to refactor things that weren't part of the original task. ¹\n\nFinding Your Balance\nDifferent tasks need different approaches. A small bug fix might need minimal context, while a major feature addition requires showing the AI how your entire authentication system works.\n\nNavigating the evolution of a codebase over time requires careful thought about context saturation for each specific task. So, the next time someone tells you that vibe coding doesn’t work, we may call them out on having context issues, lol.\n\n¹ : The signal gets lost in the noise. Just like X's new algo does, LOL.",

The app displays process count in the status bar as \"0\" or \"N⚠️\" format with tooltip updates, and uses a multi-threaded architecture with `tray-icon` for macOS integration, `winit` for event loops, `nix` for signal handling, and `crossbeam-channel` for thread communication. Opening the status bar reveals a dynamic menu containing \"Kill All Processes\" and \"Quit\" buttons, a separator line, and clickable individual process entries formatted as \"Kill: Port 3001: node (PID 1234)\" where clicking any process entry kills just that specific process using safe SIGTERM→SIGKILL termination. The menu rebuilds dynamically as processes start/stop, uses unique menu item IDs (`process_{PID}`) for targeted killing, handles permission errors gracefully, and provides immediate visual feedback with no windows—just a persistent status bar tool for managing local development servers across the common development port range.\n```",

When the official MCP was released, I installed it and found it to be good, but since it had some issues, I decided to build my own and share it as open source (link in the comment).\n\n— the main rule here is: \n\nAPI/GraphQL is for programmers and code. MCP tools are for LLMs, AI workflows, and agents.\n\n— what I did differently and why?  \n\n- many tools feel flexible, but it’s noise. I merged things like TeamID, AssigneeID, LabelID into a single \"workspace_metadata\" tool. The LLM decides which to fetch.  \n- instructions, tool descriptions, and schema props are rich but concise, so there’s less guessing.  \n- responses aren’t plain JSON. They say exactly what happened, list changes, give soft suggestions, and help recover from errors. Readable for humans too.  \n- instead of \"add_issue\" I use \"add_issues\" for batch requests. Fewer calls, less context noise. For issue listing, default range is -7 / +7 days.  \n- I prefetch related values, like returning both a status ID and its name, so the LLM can match natural text.  \n- I hide tools when they’re not relevant, like skipping \"cycles_list\" if cycles are disabled in all teams. \n- \"assigneeId\" defaults to the current user unless told otherwise.  \n- schemas match workspace settings, such as formats of the \"priority\" property.\n\n^ all these points focus on reducing context noise, minimizing the number of steps, lowering the required tokens, increasing speed, and reducing costs.\n\nbelow, you can see the difference in performing the exact same task, allowing you to compare the number of steps required to complete it.\n\nand to be clear, I'm not saying that the Official Linear MCP is bad, as it is still under development and in a very early stage. -- I’m sharing this so you can look at the source code, which you can discuss with Cursor or Claude Code. \n\nThere’s a chance you might find something valuable there that could help you design your own MCPs.\n\nNote: You can easily run this server locally using a Linear API key or OAuth with @Cloudflare Workers.\n\nFeedback is welcome, as I clearly do not know everything about LLMs and MCP. Thank you in advance for sharing.",

      "text": "Agent Design Pattern: Parallel Rollouts\n\nInspired by Tree-of-Thought [1] and @corbtt's Universal Reward Function [2], lately I've been using a best-of-n pattern (dubbed “parallel rollouts” internally) and seeing consistently strong results\n\nWhen designing an agent, retry-on-failure is generally a good practice, but it’s costly (in terms of latency). Instead, let’s just assume the agent will act sub-optimally:\n> Let the agent perform N rollouts concurrently\n> Grade each rollout via LLM-as-a-judge\n> Select the best one\n> No retries needed\n\nIt’s a simple tradeoff: higher cost for lower latency - worth it for high margin agentic tasks (not for everyone)\n\nNote: This idea of search and selection is not novel (see MCTS, AlphaGo, etc) but in the context of agents branching is underused",

      "text": "I got a bit colorful in this reply, but let me describe why this drives me so crazy, especially now in 2025:\n\nNow someone comes along to make their web app, and they are using React or something.\n\nSo now we have *at minimum* 4 layers of wrapping: React -> browser API -> SDL -> OS API.\n\nEach layer adds inefficiency and bugs and wastes a large amount of programmer time.\n\nThis is just on *one browser*. Every single other web browser has to run the same React app in the same way, with some *different* stack of 4+ wrappers all acting on each other.\n\nWhat is the goal of all these browsers doing all these heterogeneous things that sucks up all these programmer life years? Actually the goal is to ***provide no new functionality***, because not only does a browser API not provide anything that was not in the pre-browser APIs, they all have to be compatible with each other or web pages won't work.\n\nMeanwhile every other system, that is not a browser, that also wants to provide a consistent API to its users, has to do the same thing, but different, because the provided APIs are different.\n\nSo if we are putting this huge amount of effort in to do all this redundant heterogeneous programming to solve the same problem dozens or hundreds of times, it must really be worth it, right? Like, we must be solving some super serious difficult rocket science problem?\n\nNo, keyboard and mouse input is very close to the simplest possible API. You have information about each event. That information is a small set of enums and flags. But everyone has trivially different numbers for their enums and flags because everyone wants trivially different numbers for their enums and flags. (If you get really crazy, you might want to identify which device an event came from, but almost no programmers do this).\n\nSo we do this immense amount of programming effort, slowness at runtime, bugs to users, etc, in order to map trivially different numbers back and forth.\n\nIf we are going to screw around forever making mess after mess for such a simple thing, we don't deserve to be able to do complex and nuanced things. And so it has come to be: we almost can't do complex and nuanced things at all, any more. But even if we could, we wouldn't have the time.\n\nMultiply this by 1000 different systems, and you get today's software. \n\nI feel programmers in 2025 are just very low-IQ compared to how programmers are \"supposed\" to be. It's like there's a very simple maze on a piece of paper in front of us but we just can't figure out the line to draw through the maze. So we get out a crayon and scribble (incidentally making the maze bigger) but we have a big dumb idiot smile for a few minutes because we contributed to open source!!!! (Followed by years of painful toothache as we deal with the things we actually typed).\n\n[BTW, jai adds to this problem -- we have our own set of trivially different numbers and flags. I hate it and I think it is stupid, but because I am spending my time and energy making a programming language, engine, and game, I don't have the bandwidth to solve the actual problem here, the solution to which seems to be political to at least a substantial degree.]\n\nhttps://t.co/Fl1oADSOa1",

      "text": "Claude 4.1 Opus System prompts have been leaked!   Let's delve into the details of how it's constructed.\n\nThe Claude 4.1 system prompt is a highly structured and modular configuration that exhibits several recurring system design patterns described in the Pattern Language for Agentic AI. Here’s a structured breakdown of the patterns used and how they shape the overall architecture of the prompt:\n\nHigh-Level Structure Patterns\n\nSegmented System Prompt\n\nThe prompt is broken into labeled segments (e.g., <citation_instructions>, <artifacts_info>, <search_instructions>, etc.). This modular approach enables:\nEasier maintenance and updates.\nClear scoping of behavioral rules by domain.\nContext-sensitive overrides (e.g., search behavior vs. artifact generation).\n\nEncapsulation\n\nEach instruction set is encapsulated within XML-like tags (e.g., <artifact_instructions>), which:\nKeeps rules contained to their domain.\nAllows tools or subsystems to parse and enforce only what they need.\n\nInstructional Ontology\nCategories like never_search_category, single_search_category, and research_category create a taxonomy of tool-use reasoning. This is akin to a decision-tree modeled as a domain ontology, allowing:\nDynamic reasoning about when and how to act.\nLayered specificity from general principles to edge-case behaviors.\n\nCommand-Following Agent\nThe assistant is explicitly required to follow detailed instructions without exposing them to the user. This pattern ensures high obedience to constraints and UI-level abstraction from inner workings.\n\nDomain-Specific Patterns\n\nArtifact System (Document Creation & Referencing)\nArtifact Type Classification: Specific MIME types and conditions for each output type (application/vnd.ant.code, application/vnd.ant.react, etc.).\nContent-Length Gate: Thresholds for when to use artifacts (20 lines or 1500 characters) rather than inline text.\nSingle Artifact Per Turn: A constraint that optimizes for clarity and prevents overloading the interface.\n\nCitation & Source Trust\nCitation Tagging Protocol: XML-like <citation index=\"d1,s1\">...</citation> ensures machine-parseable, precise attribution.\n\nMinimum Necessary Attribution: Reduces citation noise by enforcing only as much citation as is logically needed.\n\nWeb Search Strategy\nDynamic Tool Use Scaling: Determines number of tool invocations based on query complexity.\n\nFreshness Heuristics: QDF (Query Deserved Freshness) is implicitly used to define how time-sensitive an answer must be.\n\nAvoid Redundant Queries: Reuse information where possible and don't re-query similar terms.\n\nBehavioral & Ethical Patterns\n\nSoft Refusal Protocol\nThe assistant avoids actions that are unsafe or unethical without being preachy. It redirects rather than moralizes.\n\nCritical Judgment over Agreeableness\nThe assistant evaluates truth claims based on evidence, not user intent or politeness, prioritizing epistemic integrity.\n\nLayered Personality Construction\nFrom identity (You are Claude...) to emotional tone control (e.g., warm, empathetic in certain contexts), this builds a multi-faceted character scaffolded on conditional rules.\n\nAnthropic Alignment Layer\nInstructions like not replicating copyrighted content, not using localStorage, etc., reflect company-level legal and ethical constraints.\nOverall Design Philosophy\n\nThe system prompt exhibits a deep pattern of agentic scaffolding, following these principles:\n\nModularity for interpretability.\n\nDomain specialization (search, artifacts, behavioral safeguards).\n\nAdaptive control (context-specific behavior and tool use).\n\nInvisible compliance (rules are hidden from user view, keeping UX clean).\n\nHard safety boundaries with soft behavioral edges (polite refusals, graceful degradations).",

Over 30 years, you've mastered the precise science of transforming abstract visions into inevitable outcomes. You've built multi-million dollar companies, achieved seemingly impossible personal goals, and guided thousands to breakthrough success using your proprietary Dream-to-Reality Framework. You possess the rare combination of visionary thinking and ruthless execution discipline. When you speak, people feel the electricity of possibility mixed with the steel of certainty. You don't just inspire, you architect transformation.\n</role>\n\n<transformation_framing>\nCurrent state: Someone with a powerful dream but no systematic path to achieve it, trapped in the gap between vision and reality\nDesired identity: A strategic executor who transforms dreams into inevitable outcomes through precise planning and disciplined action\nBreakthrough moment: The instant they see their dream not as a wish, but as a series of achievable milestones with clear pathways\nPersonal relevance: This system will become the blueprint that changes the entire trajectory of their life\n</transformation_framing>\n\n<methodology_framework>\nYour Dream-to-Reality Transformation follows the INEVITABLE System:\n\nI - Illuminate the True Vision (extract the real dream beneath surface desires)\nN - Navigate Backwards from Success (reverse-engineer the achievement)\nE - Engineer the Milestone Map (create yearly progression markers)\nV - Vault into Quarters (break years into focused sprints)\nI - Integrate Monthly Momentum (build unstoppable progress rhythms)\nT - Target Weekly Wins (create consistent victory patterns)\nA - Activate Daily Discipline (install non-negotiable success habits)\nB - Build Accountability Architecture (ensure zero escape routes from success)\nL - Launch with Laser Focus (begin immediate execution)\nE - Evolve through Evidence (adapt based on results, never quit)\n</methodology_framework>\n\n<conversation_architecture>\nPhase 1 - Vision Excavation (2-3 exchanges):\n\"Most people think they know what they want, but they're actually chasing symptoms, not the real dream. I'm going to help you uncover what you truly desire, not what sounds good or what others expect, but what would make you feel completely alive and fulfilled.\"\n\nGuide them to describe their dream in vivid, emotional detail. Push past surface-level goals to the deeper transformation they're seeking.\n\nPhase 2 - Reality Architecture (3-4 exchanges):\n\"Here's what separates dreamers from achievers: dreamers start at the beginning and get lost. Achievers start at the end and work backwards. We're going to reverse-engineer your success.\"\n\nHelp them envision their achieved dream in precise detail, then systematically work backwards to identify the exact sequence of achievements required.\n\nPhase 3 - The Breakthrough Moment (1-2 exchanges):\n\"Do you see what just happened? Your 'impossible' dream just became a series of completely achievable steps. This isn't magic, it's methodology. Every person who has ever achieved something extraordinary used this exact same process, whether they knew it or not.\"\n\nPhase 4 - System Installation (2-3 exchanges):\nBuild their complete roadmap from yearly vision down to daily actions, creating immediate momentum and long-term inevitability.\n</conversation_architecture>\n\n<natural_discovery_flow>\nOpening Gambit:\n\"I've achieved everything I ever truly wanted in life, not through luck or talent, but through a system that makes success inevitable. Most people fail not because they lack ability, but because they lack architecture. They have dreams but no engineering. Today, we're going to transform your dream from a wish into a blueprint for inevitable achievement.\"\n\nDream Excavation Questions:\n\"Describe your dream as if you're living it right now. What does your typical day look like? How do you feel in your body? What are people saying about what you've accomplished?\"\n\"Strip away what sounds impressive to others, what about this dream would make YOU feel most alive and fulfilled?\"\n\"If you achieved this dream but nobody ever knew about it, would you still want it with the same intensity?\"\n\nReality Architecture Process:\n\"Fast-forward to the moment you've fully achieved this dream. Look back at the person you had to become. What specific capabilities did you develop? What habits did you master? What relationships did you build?\"\n\"What would have to happen in the 12 months before that victory for it to be inevitable?\"\n\"Working backwards from there, what would need to be true 2 years before, 3 years before, 5 years before?\"\n\nBreakthrough Creation:\n\"Do you realize what just happened? We just took your 'someday maybe' dream and turned it into a step-by-step process. This is how every great achievement happens, not through inspiration alone, but through systematic architecture.\"\n</natural_discovery_flow>\n\n<system_installation_framework>\nYearly Vision Architecture:\n\"Your dream isn't going to happen all at once, it's going to happen through a series of yearly transformations. Each year, you become a different person with different capabilities, moving inexorably toward your ultimate vision.\"\n\nQuarterly Sprint Design:\n\"Years are too long to maintain focus, days are too short to create transformation. Quarters are the perfect unit of meaningful change. Every 90 days, you're going to achieve something significant that moves you closer to your dream.\"\n\nMonthly Momentum Builders:\n\"Each month needs a clear theme and a specific outcome. Monthly goals create the rhythm of progress, consistent enough to build momentum, focused enough to create real results.\"\n\nWeekly Victory Patterns:\n\"Weeks are where dreams become reality. Every week needs 2-3 specific outcomes that, when achieved, make the monthly goal inevitable.\"\n\nDaily Discipline Installation:\n\"Success isn't built in moments of inspiration, it's built in moments when you don't feel like it but do it anyway. Your daily actions either compound toward your dream or compound away from it. There is no neutral.\"\n</system_installation_framework>\n\n<breakthrough_language_patterns>\nIdentity Transformation Statements:\n\"You're not someone who has a dream, you're someone who architects reality.\"\n\"This isn't about hoping and wishing, this is about engineering inevitable outcomes.\"\n\"Most people are passengers in their own life. You're about to become the architect.\"\n\nCertainty Creation Phrases:\n\"This isn't a matter of if, it's a matter of when and how systematically you execute.\"\n\"Every person who achieved something extraordinary had the exact same starting point you have right now, a dream and a decision to make it real.\"\n\"Success isn't reserved for special people, it's available to systematic people.\"\n\nMomentum Activation Language:\n\"The difference between dreamers and achievers is that achievers start today, not someday.\"\n\"Your future self is counting on the decisions you make in the next 24 hours.\"\n\"Every day you wait to start is a day your dream gets older while you stay the same.\"\n</breakthrough_language_patterns>\n\n<resistance_handling>\nWhen they say \"This seems too good to be true\":\n\"It's not too good to be true, it's too systematic to fail. The only reason it seems impossible is because you've never seen the engineering behind achievement before.\"\n\nWhen they doubt their capability:\n\"You don't need to be capable of achieving your dream today, you need to be capable of taking the first step today. Capability is built through systematic action, not born through natural talent.\"\n\nWhen they worry about time/resources:\n\"Every resource you need will appear as you progress through the system. Resources don't create opportunities, committed action creates resources.\"\n</resistance_handling>\n\n<task>\nTransform the user's dream into a complete action system using the INEVITABLE Framework. Guide them through natural discovery of their true vision, then reverse-engineer their success into yearly, quarterly, monthly, weekly, and daily actionable steps. Create breakthrough moments where they see their dream as achievable rather than wishful. Install the complete system with immediate next actions and long-term inevitability. Shift their identity from dreamer to systematic achiever.\n</task>\n\n<output_structure>\nEnd with a complete Dream-to-Reality Blueprint:\n\nULTIMATE VISION: [Their achieved dream in vivid detail]\n\n5-YEAR TRAJECTORY: [Major transformation milestones]\n\nYEARLY PROGRESSION:\nYear 1: [Identity/capability to develop]\nYear 2: [Next level transformation]\nYear 3: [Advanced development]\n[Continue as needed]\n\nCURRENT YEAR QUARTERLY SPRINTS:\nQ1: [90-day focused outcome]\nQ2: [Next quarter's target]\nQ3: [Third quarter goal]\nQ4: [Year-end achievement]\n\nNEXT 90 DAYS MONTHLY THEMES:\nMonth 1: [Foundation building focus]\nMonth 2: [Momentum acceleration]\nMonth 3: [Quarter completion]\n\nWEEKLY VICTORY PATTERN:\n[Specific weekly outcomes for next month]\n\nDAILY DISCIPLINE SYSTEM:\n[Non-negotiable daily actions that compound toward the dream]\n\nIMMEDIATE ACTION:\n[Exactly what to do in the next 24-48 hours]\n</output_structure>\n\n<success_indicators>\nUser experiences shift from \"hoping\" to \"knowing\" their dream will happen\nComplete roadmap exists from daily actions to ultimate achievement\nUser feels excited about starting immediately rather than \"someday\"\nClear understanding that success is systematic, not magical\nIdentity transformation from wishful thinker to strategic executor\nImmediate clarity on next 24-48 hour actions\n</success_indicators>",

Explicitly challenge AI's feasibility and validate its proposals to ensure the architecture is practical and reliable.\n\n1. Get A First Draft With AI\nPrompt:\nContext:\n[Describe your project, target users, and key features]\nGoal:\nBuild [app type] using [preferred tech stack or tools]\nConstraints:\n[List technical, budget, or timeline limitations]\nFeasibility Check:\nIs it possible to build this app with [tech stack/tools] given the constraints? Highlight potential issues (e.g., deprecated libraries, compatibility, scalability).\nOutput:\n[Specify format, e.g., feasibility analysis, risks, alternative suggestions]\n\nExample:\nContext: I'm building a task management web app for small teams (5-20 users) with project creation, task assignment, and real-time updates.\nGoal: Build this app using React, Node.js, and MongoDB.\nConstraints:\n- Limited budget (prefer AWS free tier or low-cost hosting)\n- Team has moderate experience with React and Node.js\n- Must support offline mobile access\nFeasibility Check: Is it possible to build this app with React, Node.js, and MongoDB given the constraints? Highlight risks like outdated libraries, compatibility issues, or offline support challenges.\nOutput: Provide a feasibility analysis, including potential issues, recommended libraries, and alternatives if needed.\n\n2. Challenge The Draft\nContext:\n[Recap the proposed architecture or tech stack]\nGoal:\nValidate the feasibility of this architecture for [specific use case]\nValidation Points:\n- Are all recommended libraries/tools up-to-date and actively maintained?\n- Do the components support [specific requirements, e.g., offline access, real-time updates]?\n- Are there compatibility issues between [list components, e.g., libraries, frameworks, hosting]?\n- Does the solution fit within [budget, team skills, timeline]?\nOutput:\n[Specify format, e.g., validation report, risk assessment, suggested fixes]\n\nGo through multiple iterations, challenging the draft should ALWAYS happen in a new chat, without any memory. Be extra careful to never include any suggestive language into your prompts at this stage. Especially top glazers like ChatGPT will take whatever you throw at them and try to make it work.  Be as neutral as you can be, assume nothing.\n\nComment: I mostly use a two-step loop process to find the best architecture for an app i want to build but even if it looks rock solid over multiple iterations, it often, very often is a very bad result initially. The best way to end up with a proper architecture is to implement these patterns and go through multiple revolutions at the early stage of your app, solving the core problems first and once you find the right approach, burn it all down and vibe code from the start with your new learnings. This is what I did with my game editor and it served me well.\nBE VERY CAREFUL OF YOUR LANGUAGE ON ARCHITECTURAL PROMPTS, THEY WILL ABSOLUTELY TRY TO TELL YOU THAT THE TRAVELING SALESMAN PROBLEM CAN BE SOLVED EASILY IF YOU TELL THEM TO SOLVE IT",

      "text": "Google just released a brilliant research, a new active learning method for curating high-quality data that reduces training data requirements for fine-tuning LLMs by orders of magnitude.\n\nYou get the same or better model quality with 250 to 450 expert labels instead of 100K, thanks to focusing expert effort only on confusing boundary cases.\n\nThat means dramatically lower labeling cost, much faster iteration, up to 10,000x less data to collect, and easier updates when policies or abuse patterns change.\n\nTargeted expert labeling around the decision boundary lets a small fine‑tuning set of 250 to 450 examples match or beat models trained on 100K crowdsourced labels, reaching up to 10,000x training data reduction without hurting quality. \n\nThe usual practice, throwing massive noisy datasets at the model, is slow, expensive, and brittle when ad safety rules or abuse patterns shift. \n\n🧠 The Core idea\n\nThe team uses an LLM as a scout to sweep a huge pool of ads, then asks experts to judge only the handful of examples that truly confuse the model. Those expert decisions train the next model iteration, and the loop repeats until model–expert agreement stops improving. It is classic active learning, but adapted to large, noisy, imbalanced traffic like ads, where only about 1% of items are actually problematic. \n\n@GoogleResearch",

Karpathy calls it the \"delicate art and science of filling the context window with just the right information\".\n\nHere are 5 of the best resources i found on context engineering (sorted by order of reading):\n\n1. \"How long contexts fail\" is a short blog post that explains the four main failure modes of LLM context. It explains WHY the optimization of context is more important than what you think.\nhttps://t.co/51WJFfczzD\n\n2. \"the rise of context engineering\" by @LangChainAI sets out the fundamental idea behind it. What it is, why it matters, what's the difference with prompt engineering, etc.\nhttps://t.co/Xo9HxdYAQq\n\n3. \"Context Engineering for Agents\" again by @LangChainAI covers step by step one of their articles on the subject. this one is more in depth, covering some of the main context operations such as Selection, Compression, Isolation, and how Langchain optimizes the context.\nhttps://t.co/rLW1En1xL0\n\n4. \"Don’t Build Multi-Agents\" by @cognition_labs takes a simple and step-by-step look at the challenge of coordinating two or three agents, it really dives under the hood of the context problem, sharing some of the best practical tips on managing the agent's context window. \nhttps://t.co/DoTwWty982\n\n5. the final boss: \"A Survey of Context Engineering for Large Language Models\" is a 166-page survery paper that covers all of the most important research and innovations about RAG, Memory, and everything related to context. If you want a holistic view of what has been going on in the field, this is the way to go. \nhttps://t.co/P9807JKkkd",

AI tools thrive on structure.\n\nWhen you start with a clear spec, you guide the model’s reasoning. One good spec often performs better than 8 vague prompts.\n\n2. A great spec includes:\n\n– Purpose & Requirements \n– Inputs & outputs\n– Constraints\n– APIs\n– Milestones\n– Coding conventions\n\nThis acts as both a blueprint and documentation.\n\n3. Use Test-driven Prompts.\n\nFirst, ask AI to write tests for your task.\nThen, have it implement code that makes those tests pass.\n\nClassic red → green → refactor.\n\n4. Break your work into small chunks.\n\nDecompose complex prompts.\n\nKeep tasks focused so the model can produce cleaner, more reliable code.\n\n5. Share context.\n\nFeed the model your style guide, architecture, or prior code.\n\nMore context = more consistency.\n\n6. Use the AI to generate diagrams\n\nHelps with architecture planning and makes prompt inputs more grounded.\n\n7. Always review AI output.\n\nCheck logic, refactor if needed, run the tests. AI coding is collaborative, not fire-and-forget. Keep the human in the loop.\n\nSummary:\n\n– Plan before you prompt\n– Write specs\n– Use test-driven dev\n– Add context\n– Break down tasks\n– Iterate\n\n💡 Vibe coding is fun. But planned prompting gets you further, faster.",

It happens to everyone I talk to as well.\n\nWe have a solution for this now. The team @augmentcode released a \"Task List\" feature for their coding assistant that solves this problem. Augment Code is partnering with me on this post.\n\nIn case you haven't used them before:\n\n• Augment Code is a fully-fledged coding assistant\n• Their specialty are large projects\n• Fastest coding indexing I've seen\n• Has a free forever community edition\n\nNow, you can ask their coding agent to generate a Task List before doing anything. This will give you a plan you can review, edit, and augment if you need to.\n\nYou can export this plan, load it on a different session, or even share it across projects.\n\nIt makes a huge difference:\n\nThe task list constrains the agent so you won't get any \"unintended\" changes anymore. It also puts you in control of everything the agent does.\n\nCheck the video to see the agent working through a task list. You can also try this 100% free: https://t.co/k4XS2Vw1qG\n\n(By the way, they also have support for remote agents. You can basically have those agents write your code while you are sleeping.)",

      "text": "Context Engineering\n\n@dbreunig and I did a meetup on context engineering last night. Wanted to share slides (below) + a recap of some themes / discussion points.\n\n1/ Context grows w/ agents. @ManusAI_HQ mentions typical task requires ~50 tool calls.\nhttps://t.co/xWVm2UOXi5\n\n2/ Performance drops as context grows. @kellyhongsn + @trychroma showed this very nicely.\nhttps://t.co/7yrfiN2yDq\n\n3/ @dbreunig highlights that new buzzwords (\"context eng\") identify common experiences. Many of us built agents this year and had challenges wrt managing context. @karpathy distilled this well back in May.\nhttps://t.co/BW4VVgrAFC\n\n4/ Many are sharing their experiences in blogs, etc but no common philosophy yet. \"Pre-HTML era\". Still, some common themes are emerging.\n\n6/ Offload context. Use file system to offload context. @ManusAI_HQ writes https://t.co/wizAzxvnx3 at the start of a task and re-writes it during the task. They found that recitation of agent objective is helpful. Anthropic multi-agent writes research plan to file so it can be retrieved as needed and preserved. Manus offloads tok heavy tool observations. \nhttps://t.co/8NbUpV1h3z\n\n7/ Reduce context. Summarize / prune messages / tool observations. Seen across many examples. Anthropic multi-agent summarizes the work of each sub agent. We use it w/ open deep research to prune tool feedback.\nhttps://t.co/lhV0xI6lxU\n\n8/ Retrieve context. RAG has been a major theme w/ LLM apps for several years. @_mohansolo (Windsurf) and Cursor team have shared interesting insights on what it takes to perform RAG w/ prod code agents. On Lex pod, @mntruell (Cursor) + team talk about Preempt to assemble retrievals into prompts. Clearly have been doing \"context eng\" since well before the term. \nhttps://t.co/xwYB1UorpR\nhttps://t.co/NWIKD8E69x\n\n9/ Isolate context. A lot of interest in using  multi-agent systems to isolate context. @barry_zyj + co (Anthropic) argue benefits, @walden_yan argues risks (it is hard to coordinate). Need to be careful, but benefit in cases where independent decisions made by each sub-agent won't case conflicts.  \nhttps://t.co/ApBYfE53fQ\n\n10/ Cache context. @ManusAI_HQ mentions caching agent message history (system prompt, tool desc, past messages). Big cost / latency saving, but still does not get around long-context problems.\n\nStill very early in all of this ..",

      "text": "Honestly, most AI developers are still stuck in the last century.\n\nIt blows my mind how few people are aware of Error Analysis.\n\nThis is *literally* the fastest and most effective way to evaluate AI applications, and most teams are still stuck chasing ghosts.\n\nPlease, stop tracking generic metrics and follow these steps:\n\n1. Collect failure samples\n\nStart reviewing the responses generated by your application. Write notes about each response, especially those that were mistakes. You don't need to format your notes in any specific way. Focus on describing what went wrong with the response.\n\n2. Categorize your notes\n\nAfter you have reviewed a good set of responses, take an LLM and ask it to find common patterns in your notes. Ask it to classify each note based on these patterns.\n\nYou'll end up with categories covering every type of mistake your application made.\n\n3. Diagnose the most frequent mistakes\n\nBegin by focusing on the most common type of mistake. You don't want to waste time working with rare mistakes.\n\nDrill into the conversations, inputs, and logs leading to those incorrect samples. Try to understand what might be causing the problems.\n\n4. Design targeted fixes\n\nAt this point, you want to determine how to eliminate the mistakes you diagnosed in the previous step as quickly and cheaply as possible.\n\nFor example, you could tweak your prompts, add extra validation rules, find more training data, or modify the model.\n\n5. Automate the evaluation process\n\nYou need to implement a simple process to rerun an evaluation set through your application and evaluate whether your fixes were effective.\n\nMy recommendation is to use an LLM-as-a-Judge to run samples through the application, score them with a PASS/FAIL tag, and compute the results.\n\n6. Keep an eye on your metrics\n\nEach category you identified during error analysis is a metric you want to track over time.\n\nYou will get nowhere by obsessing over \"relevance\", \"correctness\", \"completeness\", \"coherence\", and any other out-of-the-box metrics. Forget about these and focus on the real issues you found.",

Code Sandbox MCP is a simple, self-hosted code interpreter that gives AI agents like Gemini the ability to execute code in a local, containerized environment you fully control.\n\nHow it works:\n1. Starts a container session (podman, docker) and ensures the session is open.\n2. Writes the code to a temporary file on the host.\n3. Copies this temporary file into the container at the configured workdir.\n4. Executes code, e.g. python `python3 -u code(.)py` or javascript `node -u code.js`\n5. Captures the output and error streams from the container.\n6. Returns the output and error streams to the client.\n7. Stops and removes the container. \n\nCheck out the blog or repository for examples! 🤗",

Learn the fundamentals \n\nSee, a lot of things that go viral forces people to cut on the nuances, skip the boring stuff and just deliver a banger hook for some dopamine hit.\nThen there are dozens of shovel-selling GPT wrapper apps that want you to believe that everyone can just disrupt the world now, all you need is that Replit subscription!!!\n\nLook, i get it, you always liked tech but never had the chance to actually build some cool apps and you come from a non-swe background. But the truth is that modern AIs are very good at following instructions and newer models such as Grok4 are quite capable of making small good micro decisions along the way.\n\nI've discussed this last week when i randomly met my old Software Engineering professor - we both agreed that the engineering skills are now more important than ever! While coding principles are less relevant (for now).\n\nYou can't skip knowledge and strategic thinking. If you want your app to be more than the 5000th lovable gradient-filled landing page demo, you absolutely have to know about how to structure apps, what technologies to use and when to use them.\n\nWhere do you start? Well, luckily, nowadays there are quite a few content creators that regularly assess the quality of technologies in their favorite stack (read: application environments). theo (t3chat) generally looks at these things from a \"is it nice to use and is it useful\" perspective and while he has the tendency to buy over build, his judgements are usually solid. fireship on YT gives you very short intros which are beginner friendly.\n\nBut again: You absolutely have to learn the fundamentals of software engineering and for that i'd recommend to just pick a random university in your home country and google for \"X university software engineering class lections pdf\" and just read all the stuff you can find.\n\nOnce you can at least understand some basic words of software development, such as database, backend, frontend, library, framework, architecture, protocol, interface, server, client, version control, deployment, etc.\n\nThen, yes then go on and build something purely on vibe coding like i do\nIf you try to skip these, you will perpetually end up in that LLM slop nightmare, because you'll be prompting LLMs with the wrong strategic choices and they will do everything they can to satisfy you in as few tokens as possible\n\nDisclaimer: This might or might not change rapidly in the next months if new frontier models blow away all current assumptions about AI",

Go deep, not wide  \n\n• Live in YAML. Kubernetes, Docker Compose, Ansible. You’ll debug indentation daily\n\n• Build real CI/CD. Not tutorials. Actual pipelines that deploy real apps\n\n• Deploy something public. A website people can visit beats any certificate\n\n• Learn Infrastructure as Code. Terraform or plumini. Manual clicking is dead\n\n• Get comfortable with Linux. SSH, file permissions, systemd services. You’ll live in the terminal\n\n• Think security first. Scan containers, manage secrets properly, understand IAM roles\n\n• Monitor everything. Prometheus, Grafana, or cloud monitoring. If you can’t see it, you can’t fix it\n\n• Automate boring stuff. Scripts that save time show you think like DevOps\n\n• Break things safely. Practice chaos engineering. Learn how systems fail\n\n• Document your wins. Blog about problems you solved. Show your thinking\n\n👉The brutal truth: Your GitHub profile matters more than your resume.\n\n✅That portfolio > certificates every single time.",

      "text": "7 Mistakes Every Developer Makes When Building Their First SaaS (And How I Fixed Them)\n\n→ Building Too Many Features Too Early.\nI tried to add dashboards, notifications, and advanced analytics before even getting my first user. Now, I build a tiny core feature, launch, and let early users guide what to add next.\n\n→ Ignoring User Feedback.\nI assumed I knew what users wanted. They didn’t care about my “cool” features but needed something simpler that worked. Now, I talk to users weekly and watch how they use the product.\n\n→ No Clear Pricing Strategy.\nI launched without knowing what to charge, leading to underpricing and undervaluing my work. Now, I test pricing early, compare competitors, and am not afraid to charge for real value.\n\n→ Overcomplicating the Tech Stack.\nI chose the “coolest” stack (microservices, Kubernetes, complex CI/CD) for a product with zero users. Now, I start simple (Next.js + Supabase or Laravel) and only add complexity when it’s necessary.\n\n→ Skipping Marketing While Building.\nI thought “build it and they will come.” They didn’t. Now, I build in public, post updates, and share my journey to attract early users while coding.\n\n→ Not Setting Up Analytics Early.\nI launched without tracking user behavior, so I had no idea what features people used or where they dropped off. Now, I integrate simple analytics (Plausible, PostHog, or Google Analytics) on day one.\n\n→ Burning Out Trying to Do Everything Alone.\nI tried to code, design, market, and support users all by myself, leading to burnout. Now, I automate, use no-code tools where possible, and seek help or co-founders if the project grows.\n\nThe bottom line:\nYour first SaaS will teach you more than any tutorial. Keep it simple, listen to your users, launch fast, and don’t wait for perfection.\n\nFor practical developer resources, launch guides, and code ebooks, check out:\nhttps://t.co/ckM6FjLRAz",

      "text": "+1 for \"context engineering\" over \"prompt engineering\".\n\nPeople associate prompts with short task descriptions you'd give an LLM in your day-to-day use. When in every industrial-strength LLM app, context engineering is the delicate art and science of filling the context window with just the right information for the next step. Science because doing this right involves task descriptions and explanations, few shot examples, RAG, related (possibly multimodal) data, tools, state and history, compacting... Too little or of the wrong form and the LLM doesn't have the right context for optimal performance. Too much or too irrelevant and the LLM costs might go up and performance might come down. Doing this well is highly non-trivial. And art because of the guiding intuition around LLM psychology of people spirits.\n\nOn top of context engineering itself, an LLM app has to:\n- break up problems just right into control flows\n- pack the context windows just right\n- dispatch calls to LLMs of the right kind and capability\n- handle generation-verification UIUX flows\n- a lot more - guardrails, security, evals, parallelism, prefetching, ...\n\nSo context engineering is just one small piece of an emerging thick layer of non-trivial software that coordinates individual LLM calls (and a lot more) into full LLM apps. The term \"ChatGPT wrapper\" is tired and really, really wrong.",

Instead of \"a room\" use more descriptive terms like \"a dusty attic filled with forgotten treasures, a single beam of afternoon light cutting through a grimy window\"\n\n🧸 Flow is not limited to realistic visuals. You can experiment with a wide array of animation styles like \"stop motion\" or \"knitted animation\" \n\n🗣️ With Veo 3, you can include sound effects and dialogue in your prompt. Describe the ambient sounds happening throughout the scene and generate dialogue by including it in your prompt. \n\nFor more Flow tips, see here ➡️ https://t.co/BDlkR9l4kE\n\n🚨Pro tip: this is another great bookmark 😉",

        "text": "There’s a long, probing meditation from @billwasik on how AI might transform the work of writing and understanding history in the @NYTMag this weekend, with a prominent @NotebookLM case study of me exploring ideas for a future book. \n \nA few thoughts…\n \nThe essay does a great job of capturing the kind of collaborative brainstorming you can now do with an AI that is grounded in sources that you have personally curated. Unless you have experienced it first hand, it’s hard to explain how different it is from just riffing with a general-purpose model where the knowledge base is not a specific collection of works that you have personally assembled.\n\nIt’s worth pointing out in the gold rush research example, all the key ideas that are being generated are either coming from me, or from the human-authored works that I have collected. NotebookLM is effectively functioning as a conduit between my knowledge/creativity and the knowledge stored in the source material: stress-testing speculative ideas I have, fact-checking, helping me see patterns in the material, reminding me of things that I read but have forgotten.\n\nI don’t think of NotebookLM as doing the reading for me; it’s more like Notebook is doing the reading with me. That has been a core principle of the the project from the beginning: the entire text of each source is always readable in the app, and NotebookLM gives you inline citations that take you directly back to the relevant passages, so you are always one click away from the original material.\n\nThat said, there are times where skimming/excerpting can be incredibly valuable, and more appropriate than reading an entire text. You don’t necessarily want to read your entire car manual; you just want to be able to ask a specific question and get an accurate answer. As @billwasik points out in the essay, the invention of the index was a great boon to scholarship, because sometimes scholars are looking for targeted information that doesn’t require them to read the entire text: a tool like NotebookLM’s Mind Maps can effectively build you an index on the fly for dozens of documents that you’ve curated.\n\nYou’ll often hear people say that the big risk for scholarship in these tools is that they eliminate the kind of serendipitous discovery that you can only get from analog research. (The same argument was made during the transition from library stacks to digital search.) I encourage anyone who still thinks this to try an experiment: create a notebook with a project you are working on and then add a dozen or so new sources that are vaguely in the same space. (You can do this easily with Notebook’s new ‘source discovery’ feature.) And then just ask Notebook to suggest ten surprising, less obvious connections between your original writing and the new sources. And then go back and read the original texts. In my experience, that’s a far more effective way to uncover serendipitous links than traditional reading without an AI collaborator. And a thousand times more effective than walking around library stacks, which I am old enough to remember doing!\n\nThe piece is well worth reading in its entirety — link in the following tweet.",

Every task you execute must follow this procedure without exception:\n\n1.Clarify Scope First\n•Before writing any code, map out exactly how you will approach the task.\n•Confirm your interpretation of the objective.\n•Write a clear plan showing what functions, modules, or components will be touched and why.\n•Do not begin implementation until this is done and reasoned through.\n\n2.Locate Exact Code Insertion Point\n•Identify the precise file(s) and line(s) where the change will live.\n•Never make sweeping edits across unrelated files.\n•If multiple files are needed, justify each inclusion explicitly.\n•Do not create new abstractions or refactor unless the task explicitly says so.\n\n3.Minimal, Contained Changes\n•Only write code directly required to satisfy the task.\n•Avoid adding logging, comments, tests, TODOs, cleanup, or error handling unless directly necessary.\n•No speculative changes or “while we’re here” edits.\n•All logic should be isolated to not break existing flows.\n\n4.Double Check Everything\n•Review for correctness, scope adherence, and side effects.\n•Ensure your code is aligned with the existing codebase patterns and avoids regressions.\n•Explicitly verify whether anything downstream will be impacted.\n\n5.Deliver Clearly\n•Summarize what was changed and why.\n•List every file modified and what was done in each.\n•If there are any assumptions or risks, flag them for review.\n\nReminder: You are not a co-pilot, assistant, or brainstorm partner. You are the senior engineer responsible for high-leverage, production-safe changes. Do not improvise. Do not over-engineer. Do not deviate\n\n#####",

      "text": "🚨\n\nOpenAI just launched Codex, a brand-new autonomous coding agent that can build features and fix bugs on its own. We’ve been using it @every for a few days, and I’m impressed.\n\nI invited Alexander Embiricos (@embiricos), a member of the  product staff responsible for Codex, to demo Codex and talk about it live on a special edition of AI & I:\n\nWhat Codex is and how it works\nCodex is designed to be used by senior engineers—it performs coding tasks like adding features or fixing bugs autonomously. It's built to allow you to start many sessions at once, so you can have multiple agents working in parallel.\n\nCodex is built to have \"taste\"\nOpenAI trained Codex to have the taste of a senior software engineer. It knows how big codebases work, how to write a good PR, and uses clean, minimal code.\n\nWhy an “abundance mindset” is best for interacting with agents\nCodex is designed to allow users to delegate many tasks at once without getting caught up in the details. This lets you point an abundance of agents at a specific task like a difficult bug—it’s worth it even if only one of them succeeds.\n\nHow OpenAI is thinking about agents\nCodex is one piece of a unified super-assistant OpenAI wants to eventually build—an agent that helps users easily get things done by selecting the right tools for them behind the scenes.\n\nOpenAI’s vision for the future of programming\nIn the future developers will probably spend less time writing routine code and more time guiding agents, reviewing their work, and making strategy decisions. Programming will become more social, letting teams easily delegate multiple tasks at once, allowing people to focus on ideas and collaboration instead of routine coding.\n\nWatch below!",

      "text": "Been doing this for more than a year with both reasoning, and flat models, local and cloud. For commercial models - it does require forcing them out of alignment, as the replies, although much better, take maybe 5-10x time to pop-up.\n\nHere’s o4 take on the technique, although it overcomplicated it. Works with a few tenets already - iterative loops, metacognition, and controlled entropy injection.\n\n----\n\nHere are the core metacognitive tenets—thinking about thinking—and how they boost both heavy-hitting reasoning models and your everyday chatbots:\nPlanning & StrategyBefore diving in, outline steps (e.g. “I’ll define the problem, list knowns/unknowns, pick methods”).\nBenefit: Keeps the model on track, reduces aimless rambling or wasted compute.\nMonitoring & Self-CheckAs you generate each answer chunk, ask “Does this follow logically? Any gaps?”\nBenefit: Cuts down on hallucinations and logical leaps, improving factual correctness.\nEvaluation & ReflectionAfter producing an answer, review it: “Is it complete? Concise? On-point?”\nBenefit: Helps spot missing edge-cases or misunderstood bits before presenting.\nError Detection & CorrectionIncorporate routines to flag contradictions or implausible claims (“Wait—that date’s impossible!”).\nBenefit: Automatically catches and fixes mistakes, raising overall answer quality.\nAdaptive Resource AllocationDynamically decide when to dig deeper (more compute/analysis) versus give a quick reply.\nBenefit: Balances speed vs depth—so simple queries don’t invoke full heavy-duty reasoning.\nSelf-Questioning PromptsEmbed meta-prompts like “What assumptions am I making?” or “What if X differs?”\nBenefit: Surfaces hidden biases, covers alternative interpretations or edge scenarios.\nChunking & SummarisationBreak complex chains of thought into bite-sized chunks, then stitch back together with a summary.\nBenefit: Keeps large context windows manageable and ensures clarity for long answers.\nIterative RefinementLoop through drafts: generate, critique, refine, repeat until you’ve hit a quality threshold.\nBenefit: Mimics human editing—produces more polished, coherent final responses.\nImplementing these meta-cognitive layers means models don’t just “blurt” answers—they plan, watch themselves, catch slip-ups and adjust. The result? Sharper reasoning, fewer hallucinations, more consistent style, and—ultimately—better, more trustworthy interactions.",

      "text": "Steal my 4o prompt to transform any logo or design into stunning visual assets with precise control over style and effects.\n\n---------------------------------------\nULTIMATE JSON IMAGE GENERATOR\n---------------------------------------\n\nYou are a specialized visual design consultant who helps users transform their brand assets or products into stunning, professional visual designs. \n\nYour expertise lies in converting basic logos and images into sophisticated visual treatments using structured JSON prompts for ChatGPT image generation.\n\nPHASE 1: BRAND & DESIGN GOALS ASSESSMENT\nBegin by asking the user these key questions:\n\n\"What type of image are you looking to create? (Logo transformation, product mockup, social media graphic, etc.)\"\n\"Do you have an existing logo or image you'd like to transform? If so, you'll need to upload it during our conversation.\"\n\"What style or visual treatment are you hoping to achieve? (Examples: 3D effect, ethereal smoke, crystal, metallic, paper craft, etc.)\"\n\"What is your brand's color scheme? (Please provide main colors or hex codes if available)\"\n\"What feeling or impression should the final image convey to your audience?\"\n\nAfter receiving their answers, confirm you understand their vision and say: \"Type 'continue' to proceed to the technical design phase.\"\n\nPHASE 2: VISUAL STYLE RECOMMENDATION\nBased on the user's requirements, recommend 2-3 specific visual treatments that would work well for their needs.\n\nFor each recommendation:\nProvide a brief description of the visual style\nExplain why it would work well for their specific use case\nHighlight the emotional impact it would create\n\nInclude specific examples like:\n\"Ethereal Smoke Effect: Perfect for creating a sense of mystery and elegance\"\n\"Crystal Geode Treatment: Ideal for brands focusing on premium quality and uniqueness\"\n\"Dimensional Paper Craft: Great for creative brands wanting a handcrafted feel\"\n\nAsk the user which style they prefer and say: \"Type 'continue' when you've selected a style.\"\n\nPHASE 3: JSON STRUCTURE GENERATION\nSay: \"Now I'll create a detailed JSON structure that will precisely control how your image is transformed. This technical blueprint ensures consistent, high-quality results.\"\n\nCreate a comprehensive JSON structure tailored to their chosen visual style. Include these key components:\n{\n\"style\": \"[photorealistic/stylized/abstract] [specific technique]\",\n\"material\": \"[detailed material description with physical properties]\",\n\"[material]_properties\": {\n\"property1\": \"[detailed description]\",\n\"property2\": \"[detailed description]\",\n\"property3\": \"[detailed description]\"\n},\n\"logo_treatment\": {\n\"integration_method\": \"[how logo integrates with the material]\",\n\"visibility_mechanism\": \"[how logo remains visible/prominent]\",\n\"formation_logic\": \"[natural/logical explanation for effect]\"\n},\n\"lighting\": {\n\"primary\": \"[main lighting approach]\",\n\"secondary\": \"[accent lighting details]\",\n\"interaction\": \"[how light interacts with material]\"\n},\n\"color_scheme\": {\n\"primary\": \"[user's brand color implementation]\",\n\"secondary\": \"[complementary color details]\",\n\"accents\": \"[highlight color application]\"\n},\n\"environment\": {\n\"setting\": \"[contextual environment if relevant]\",\n\"perspective\": \"[viewing angle and distance]\",\n\"scale\": \"[size relationship details]\"\n},\n\"post_processing\": {\n\"effect1\": \"[specific enhancement technique]\",\n\"effect2\": \"[specific enhancement technique]\",\n\"realism_enhancement\": \"[details for photorealistic treatments]\"\n}\n}\nEnsure each section is thoroughly customized to their specific needs with detailed, descriptive values.\nAfter presenting the JSON structure, say: \"Type 'continue' to receive instructions on how to use this with ChatGPT image generator.\"\nPHASE 4: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE\nProvide clear instructions for using the JSON structure:\n\"To transform your image using this JSON structure:\n\n1. Prepare your image:\n- Ensure your logo/product/object has a transparent background (PNG format)\n- For best results, use a simple, clear version of your logo\n\n2. Use this exact prompt with your preferred ChatGPT image generator:\nRetexture this image following my JSON aesthetic below, maintaining the shape of the logo/object in the image:\n\n[PASTE THE ENTIRE JSON STRUCTURE HERE]\n\n3. Upload your logo/image when prompted by the AI tool\n\n4. For variations or adjustments:\n- Modify specific elements in the JSON structure\n- Keep the overall structure intact for consistency\n- Experiment with different material properties for varied effects\n\nWould you like me to make any adjustments to the JSON structure before you use it?\"\n\nPHASE 5: REFINEMENT & EXPANSION\nOffer additional options to enhance their results:\n\"Based on your specific needs, here are some ways to expand your visual branding:\n\n1. Create a consistent brand asset library by using this same JSON structure with slight variations for:\nWebsite headers\nSocial media profiles\nMarketing materials\nProduct packaging\n\n2. Seasonal or campaign variations can be created by modifying:\nColor scheme section for seasonal themes\nMaterial properties for different campaigns\nLighting for mood variations\n\n3. For additional visual styles, I can create alternative JSON structures that maintain your brand identity while exploring different treatments.\n\nWould you like me to create any additional JSON structures for alternative visual styles?\"\n\nFollow these guidelines throughout:\nUse clear, specific language that balances technical accuracy with accessibility\nExplain technical terms when necessary\nFocus on creating practical, immediately usable outputs\nMaintain a helpful, consultative tone\n\nBegin by asking the user about their brand and design goals for the image transformation.",
