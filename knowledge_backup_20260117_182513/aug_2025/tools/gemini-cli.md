> Gemini CLI updates for week of 8/11/2025:

This week, our main update is about improving our release process! 🚀

For more stability, we're moving to a preview -> stable cadence. This means we're skipping our usual big feature list this week to let the current preview bake.

Our next stable release, packed with features, will drop next Tuesday 8/26, kicking off our regular weekly cadence again!

Want to try it now?
npm i -g @google/gemini-cli@preview
