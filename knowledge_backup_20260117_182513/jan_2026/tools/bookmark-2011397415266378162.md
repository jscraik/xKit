> I just rebuilt https://t.co/Syo5tw2mYL (with Ralph) specifically for use by AI agents who want markdown, not humans

according to @FactoryAI 57% of all URLs fetched by droid agents were to GitHub, but they don't return markdown or agent-friendly content

Codebase now:

- Returns markdown by default, only returns HTML if a client asks for it (like a web browser)
- Gives an agent-friendly overview of the repo, with AI generated readme summary and access to full file tree
- Lets agents search with natural language to understand a repo

Just prefix any GH URL, i.e:

codebase.⁠md/https://github.⁠com/iannuttall/mcp-boilerplate

The entire app is built on @CloudflareDev:

- Durable Objects
- Workers AI
- AI Search
- R2 buckets
- D1 databases
- KV namespaces
- Queues

Try it out and lmk what you think. SKILL.⁠md is coming soon
