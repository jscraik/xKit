> Very impressive website design from @Zai_org GLM 4.7

Prompt One:
I want you to really impress me with what you can do

It's my first time using you so would like to know what your capabilities are and what you can showcase to me, especially from a visual design perspective 

You have access to skills, run these first
- "openskills read zai-cli"  
- "openskills read dev-browser" 

Prompt Two:
I think you can do better than that. It can be more polished around it. That's just like trying to show off it doesn't really work that great. Ultrathink.

Final Prompt:
Any improvements you would like to make? Add more pages, make it cooler. Make it more unique, be interesting.
